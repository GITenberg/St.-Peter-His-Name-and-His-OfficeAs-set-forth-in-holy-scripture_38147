<hr style="width: 15%;" />

<p>The present work took its rise, and is largely drawn,
from the very learned Father Passaglia's "Commentary
on the Prerogatives of St. Peter, Prince of the Apostles,
as proved by the authority of Holy Writ," which was
published in Latin, in 1850. The eighth and ninth chapters
are, indeed, translations, respectively, of the twenty-seventh
of his first book, and the first of his second
book. And as to the rest, my obligations are more
than I can specify. I owe, on the other hand, many
excuses to Father Passaglia, for while I have only
partially observed his order in treating the subject, I
have considered his whole work as a treasure-house
of learning, whence I might draw at my pleasure
"things old and new," adapting them, as I thought good,
to the needs of the Protestant mind, as familiar to me
in England. Thus I have not scrupled to translate, to
omit, or to insert matter of my own, according to my
judgment. It seemed to me of paramount importance to
present to the English reader the whole chain of scriptural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>evidence for the Primacy and prerogatives of St.
Peter. This chain of evidence is so strong, that, when
I first saw it completely drawn out, it struck my own
mind, brought up in the prejudices of Protestantism, with
the force of a new revelation. I put to myself the
question; is it possible that they who specially profess
to draw their faith from the written Word of God,
would refuse to acknowledge a doctrine set forth in Holy
Scripture with at least as strong evidence as the Godhead
of our Lord itself, if they could see it not broken up into
morsels, like bits of glass reflecting a distorted and imperfect
image, according to the fashion of citing separate
texts without regard to the proportion of the faith, but
presented in a complete picture on the mirror of God's
Word? This picture is thus complete and perfect in Father
Passaglia's work. Yet the form of that work, no less
than its bulk, the scrupulous minuteness with which every
opposite interpretation of so many adversaries in modern
times is answered, as well as the fulness with which every
part of the subject is treated, made me feel that a simple
translation would not be tolerated by the impatience of a
population, which has little time and less mind for studies
of this character. I have pursued, therefore, the humble
task of <i>popularising</i>, so far as I could, Father Passaglia's
work, omitting, as I trust, no essential part of the argument,
and grouping it under different combinations, each
of which might be in turn presented to the eye, and so
more readily embraced.</p>

<p>The importance of the argument, as it affects the Papal
Supremacy, which is but a summary of the whole cause at
issue between Protestantism in every shape, and the Church
of Christ, cannot be overrated. If St. Peter be already
set forth in Scripture as the Head and Bond of the Apostolic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>
College, if he be delineated as the supreme Ruler
who succeeds our Lord Himself in the visible government
of His Church on earth, there becomes at once the strongest
ground for expecting that such a Ruler will be continued
as long as the Church herself lasts. Thus a guiding
clue is given to us among all the following records of
antiquity. Tradition and history become illuminated with
a light which exhibits all objects in their due proportion
and true grouping, when they are shown to be but the
realisation of what the Incarnate Word, His Church's one
only Lawgiver, decreed from the beginning, set forth not
only in prophetic image, but distinct command, and stored
up in words of such exceeding power, that they bear the
whole weight of the kingdom of God, stretching through
all ages and nations, without effort or pressure. And if
ancient writers speak in no doubtful tone of St. Peter's
prerogatives, yet clearer, more emphatic, and soul-piercing,
as we should expect, are the words of God Himself, appealing
in man's form to the mind and heart of man, whom
He had created, and was come to redeem, and to knit into
one eternal monarchy.</p>

<p>A subsequent part of the argument, namely, that the
Bishop of Rome <i>is</i> successor of St. Peter, has been treated
by the author in another work, "The See of St. Peter the
Rock of the Church, the Source of Jurisdiction, and the
Centre of Unity," specially in the fifth section, which ought,
logically, to be preceded by this treatise. It is there
proved that not only the Christian Fathers, as individual
writers and witnesses, but the ancient Church in her universal
Councils, did, with one voice, from age to age, regard
the Pope as sitting in St. Peter's chair, which is proof
enough, and all that can in reason be demanded, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>
prerogatives given to St Peter as Head of the Church
were, in the belief of the Church, and in full accordance
with our Lord's own promise,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> continued on to his successors,
and are as imperishable as the life of the Church
herself.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>THE NAME OF PETER PROMISED, CONFERRED, AND EXPLAINED.</h3>


<p>Our Lord tells us that He came upon earth to "finish a
work;" and He likewise tells us what that work was, the
setting up a living society of men, who should dwell in Him
and He in them; on whom His Spirit should rest, with whom
His presence should abide, until the consummation of all
things. For, the evening before His passion, "lifting up
His eyes to heaven, He said: Father, the hour is come. *
* * I have glorified Thee on the earth: I have finished
the work which Thou gavest Me to do. * * I have
manifested Thy name to the men whom Thou hast given Me
out of the world. Thine they were, and to Me Thou gavest
them; and they have kept Thy word. * Holy Father,
keep them in Thy name, whom Thou has given Me; that
they may be one, as We also are. While I was with them I
kept them in Thy name.&mdash;And now I come to Thee.&mdash;I
pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world,
but that Thou shouldest keep them from evil. * * As
Thou hast sent me into the world, I also have sent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
into the world. And for them do I sanctify Myself, that
they also may be sanctified in truth. And not for them
only do I pray, but for those also who through their word
shall believe in Me; that they all may be one, as Thou,
Father, in Me, and I in Thee; that they also may be one
in Us; that the world may believe that Thou hast sent Me.
And the glory which Thou hast given to Me, I have given
to them, that they may be one, as We also are one. I in
them, and Thou in Me; that they may be made perfect in
one; and the world may know that Thou hast sent Me, and
hast loved them as Thou hast loved Me. * * And I have
made known Thy name to them, and will make it known;
that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in
them, and I in them."<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In these terms the Eternal Word condescends to declare
to us that the fruit of His Incarnation, the "finished work"
which His Father had given Him to do, was the establishment
of a society whose unity in "truth" and "love" should
be so perfect, that He exemplifies it by the indwelling in
each other of the Divine Persons; which should be perpetual
and visible for ever, so that the world by it and in it
should recognise His own mission, and believe in the Sender;
and that the dowry of this society, thus perpetually visible,
should be the equally perpetual possession of truth&mdash;the
revelation of God's will&mdash;and of love, which is conformity to
it. And He based these unexampled promises on no less a
guarantee than the Almighty Power and ineffable Goodness
of His Father, witnessed by His own dwelling amongst us
in our flesh.</p>

<p>Elsewhere He termed this society His Church, declared
that He would <a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>"build it on a rock, and that the gates of hell
should not prevail against it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p><p>He told those whom He had set over it to go forth in His
name, and to teach all nations whatsoever He had commanded
them, adding the solemn engagement on His own
part, <a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>"Behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation
of the world."</p>

<p>His whole teaching is full of reference to it, setting forth
its nature with every variety of illustration, enfolding it, as
it were, with an exuberance of divine charity.</p>

<p>But two conceptions run through every illustration, and
are involved in its primary idea, nay, as this was the finished
work of His Incarnation, so are they found in His adorable
Person, from which His work springs. These conceptions
are Unity and Visibility.</p>

<p>As the mystery of the Incarnation consists in the union
of the divine and human natures, in one Person, and in the
assumption of a body, that is, matter, by the one uncreated,
incomprehensible, and invisible Being, whereby He becomes
visible, so Unity and Visibility are the unfailing marks of His
Church, and enter into every image of it, in such a manner
that without them the image loses its point and significancy.</p>

<p>Accordingly He proclaims the Church which He was
founding to be "the Kingdom of God," and "the Kingdom
of Heaven," thus bringing before us the conceptions of order,
government, power, headship on the one hand, dependence
on the other, and a host of mutual relations between the
Sovereign and the people, significantly remarking that "a
kingdom which is divided against itself must fall." Now, a
kingdom without unity is a contradiction in terms, and a
kingdom of God on earth, which cannot be seen, would be
for spirits and not for men.</p>

<p>So He calls it a <a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>"city seated on a mountain," which
"cannot be hid," answering to His prophet's words, "the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>city of the great King," "His rest, and His habitation for
ever." Here again are embodied the notions of order,
government, conspicuous majesty, impregnable strength.</p>

<p>Thus He inspires His apostle to call it <a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>"the house of
God, the pillar and ground of the truth." The house must
have its head, the family their father; the knowledge of
that father's will is the truth which rests upon the family
as its support and pillar. Outside of the family that knowledge
may be lost, together with the will to obey the father
and to love him; but within it is a living tradition, "familiar
to the ear as household words." As long as the Master
and the Father is there, a perpetual light from His face is
there too upon His children and His servants.  Divide the
house, or corrupt its internal life, and the idea of the house
is destroyed; while an invisible house is an absurdity.</p>

<p>Again, the Lord, calling Himself <a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>"the Good Shepherd,
who giveth His life for the sheep," terms His Church the
sheepfold, and declares that as there is one shepherd, so
there must be one fold.</p>

<p>But, rising yet in nearness to the Divine Person of the
Word Incarnate, from whose side sleeping on the cross she
is moulded, the Church is called His Spouse, as united to
Him in eternal wedlock, <a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>"a great Sacrament," or mystery;
and even yet more, His Body, as supported by the continual
influx of her Head; and all her members are called
"flesh of His flesh, and bone of His bones."</p>

<p>It is evident, then, that in these promises and illustrations
are set forth, as belonging to their object, a visible unity, a
perpetual possession and maintenance of the truth, and the
closest union with God, founded upon a most supernatural
indwelling of the Godhead in a society of men on earth, the
founding of which was the "finished work" of God the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>Word Incarnate. <i>Were these promises to fail in any
respect</i>, which is utterly impossible, for while heaven and
earth shall pass away, no word of their Maker can pass
away&mdash;<i>it is plain that our ground for trusting in any
promises of Holy Writ whatsoever would be demolished</i>.
The whole Christian revelation rests on the imperishable
life of the Church; because the corruption or
division of the Church would falsify the written records of
our faith, in which, after the doctrine of the Blessed Trinity,
and the Godhead of our Lord, no truth is so deeply embedded
as the perpetual existence and office of the Church.</p>

<p>We have seen the idea of King, Lord, Master, Father,
Shepherd, Husband, and Head, running through the delineation
of the Church. And no society is complete without
its ruler. Such was our Lord, while on earth&mdash;the <i>visible</i>
ruler of a <i>visible</i> Church. "While I was with them I kept
them in Thy name." He went forth from His baptism to
win souls. The water became wine in His presence. He
bade men follow Him, and they followed. Power went forth
from Him, and healed diseases. Grace flowed from His lips
and conquered hearts. An innumerable multitude surrounded
Him, of all ages and conditions. <a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>"And going up
into a mountain He called unto Him whom He would Himself;
and they came to Him. And He made that twelve
should be with Him, and that He might send them to
preach."</p>

<p>Here, then, the true Israel chooses the future princes of
His house, who should sit with Him on thrones, judging the
twelve tribes. Already, while yet with His Church, He is
preparing for her future government, when His visible
presence shall be taken from her. In three years all
should be accomplished, but when <a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>"the covenant should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>have been confirmed with many in one week, and in the
half of the week the victim and the sacrifice should fail;"
when His Apostles should see Him no longer; was any one
ordained to take that all-important place of supreme ruler
which He had filled? For upon earth He had been in two
relations to His Church, her Founder, and her Ruler. The
former office belonged to His single Person; in its nature
it could not pass to another; the work was finished once
and for ever. But the latter office was, in its nature likewise,
perpetual. How, then, should the charge of visible
ruler, as man among men, be executed, when His Person
was withdrawn, when He ascended up on high, when all
power in heaven and earth was indeed given into His
hands, and so the headship of spiritual influence and providential
care; but when, nevertheless, that sacred Body was
withdrawn into the tabernacle of God, and the Bridegroom
was taken away for a time, and the voice and visible presence <a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>"what
they had seen, and heard, and handled, of
the word of life," "was with them and kept them" no
longer. Should His Church, which had been under one
visible ruler from the beginning, now have her government
changed? Or had He marked out any one among the
Twelve to succeed to His own office of visible headship,
and to be <a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>"the greater," and "the ruler" among His
brethren. His own special representative and vicar?</p>

<p>To answer this question, we must carefully observe and
distinguish what is said and what is given to the Apostles
<i>in common</i>, and what to any one of their number <i>in particular</i>;
the former will instruct us as to their equality, the
latter as to the pre-eminence which any one enjoyed over
the rest, and in what it consisted.</p>

<p>Just, then, as at a certain period of His ministry, our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>Lord, out of the multitude who followed Him, selected
twelve, to be His special attendants upon earth, and, when
He should be taken up, to be the heralds of His Gospel
among all nations, so out of the twelve He from the beginning
distinguished one, marked him out for a peculiar and
singular office, connected him with Himself in a special
manner, and after having through the whole of His ministry
given him tokens and intimations of his future destination,
at last expressly nominated him to take His own
place, and preside among his brethren. His dealing with
this Apostle forms one connected whole, in which there is
nothing abrupt or inharmonious, out of keeping, or opposed
to what He said to others. What is at first obscurely intimated
is afterwards expressly promised, again in fresh
terms corroborated, and at last, in yet other language, but
of the like force, most significantly <a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>conveyed, while it
is attested by a number of incidental notices scattered
through the whole Gospel history. Thus <a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>it becomes
necessary to consider each particular, as well as the whole
sum of things said, <i>proper</i> and <i>peculiar</i> to this Apostle; to
weigh first their <i>separate</i> and then their <i>joint</i> force, and
only at last to form an united judgment upon all.</p>

<p>We are searching into the will of the Divine Founder of
our faith, which He has not only communicated to His
Church in a living tradition, but in this case likewise
ordered to be set forth in authentic written documents.
These alone we are here considering, and the point in question
is whether He decreed that all the Twelve should share
equally in that divine mission and authority which He had
received from the Father, or whether while bestowing on
them all very high and distinctive powers, He yet appointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>one, namely Simon, the son of Jonas, to preside over the
rest in His own place. We have, then, to consider all in these
documents which is said peculiar to such apostle, pointing out
singular gifts and prerogatives, and carrying with it special
authority of government. And we must remember that
where proofs are numerous and complex, some which in
themselves are only probable and accessory, yet have their
force on the ultimate result. But this result must be drawn
from a general view of the whole, and will collect in one the
sum of proof both probable and certain.</p>

<p>Again, where many various causes concur, some more
and some less, to produce a certain effect, the force of such
effect is the force of all these causes put together, not of
each by itself alone. Or where many witnesses are examined,
whose evidence differs in value, although the testimony of
some be in itself decisive, yet the verdict must be given
after a consideration and review of all.</p>

<p>Now the first mention which we have of the Apostle
Simon is full of signification. Our Lord had only just
begun His ministry; he had been lately baptized, and as
yet had called no disciples. But two of John the Baptist's
disciples hearing their master name Jesus "the Lamb of
God," follow Him, are kindly received by Him, and one
of them being Andrew, Simon's brother, finds Simon,
and says to him, <a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>"we have found the Messias. And
he brought him to Jesus. And Jesus looking on him
said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonas; thou shalt be
called Cephas, which is interpreted Peter:" as if He
would say, by birth thou art Simon, son of John;
but another and a higher lot is in store for thee. I will
give thee another name which thou shalt bear, a name in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>itself signifying the place which thou shalt hold in my
Church. Thou shalt be called, and thou shalt be, the Rock.</p>

<p>For why, when a vast multitude of our Lord's words and
actions have been omitted, was this recorded for us, save
that a deep meaning lay in it? Or what could that meaning
be when our Lord, for the first time looking on Peter,
promised to him and to him alone, a new name, and that a
name given in prophecy to Himself, a name declaring by its
very sound that he should be laid by the builder, as a foundation
of the structure about to be raised? So in the fourth
century S. Chrysostome comments on the text, calling him
"the foundation of the Church, he that was really Peter"
(the Rock) "both in name and in deed:"<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and a little
after S. Cyril, of Alexandria, "with allusion to the rock He
transferred His name to Peter, for upon him He was about
to found His Church." The Creator of the world does not
give a name for nothing. His word is with power, and does
what it expresses. Of old, "He spake and they were made;
He commanded and they were created." Now, too, He
speaks, at the first dawn of His great spiritual restoration.
When as yet nothing has been done, and not a stone of the
divine building reared, He who determines the end from the
beginning looks upon what seemed a simple fisherman, and
at first beholding him, He takes Simon, the son of Jonas, out
of the roll of common men; He marks him for a future
design; He wraps him in a prophetic title; He associates
him with His own immovable power. Of Himself it had
been said,<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> "Behold I will lay a stone in the foundation of
Sion, a tried stone, a corner stone, a precious stone, founded
on the foundation. He that believeth, let him not hasten."
And again, "the stone which the builders rejected, the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing,
and it is wonderful in our eyes." And again, "A stone was
cut out of a mountain without hands; and it struck the
statue upon the feet thereof that were of iron and clay, and
broke them in pieces. But the stone that struck the statue
became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth." And
again, "Behold the stone that I have laid before Jesus:
upon one stone there are seven eyes; behold I will grave
the graving thereof, saith the Lord of Hosts; and I will
take away the iniquity of that land in one day." In reference
to which S. Paul said of Christians, that they are
"built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner-stone; in whom
all the building, being framed together, groweth up into a
holy temple in the Lord." It is plain, then, that our Lord
"both by the Old and New Testament,<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> is called a stone."</p>

<p>But this which He had of Himself, and by virtue of His
own divine power, as the Word of God, He would communicate
in a degree, and by dependence on Himself, to
another. This is no modern interpretation, but the very
words of St. Ambrose, "Great is the grace of Christ, who
bestowed almost all His own names on His disciples. I,
said He, am the light of the world, and yet He granted to
His disciples the very name in which He exulted, by the
words, Ye are the light of the world. Christ is the Rock,
but yet He did not deny the grace of this name to His
disciple, that he should be Peter, because he has from the
Rock firm constancy, immovable faith."<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>In the third century, Origen, on this very text, observes:
"He said he should be called Peter, by allusion to the
Rock, which is Christ, that as a man from wisdom is
termed wise, and from holiness holy, so too Peter from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Rock." And in the fifth, S. Leo paraphrases the name
thus: "While I am the inviolable Rock, the Corner-stone,
who make both one, the foundation beside which no one can
lay another; yet thou also art the rock, because by My
virtue thou art established, so as to enjoy by participation
the properties which are peculiar to Me."<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p>Here, then, we have three facts: i. That our Lord having
twelve Apostles whom He chose, loved, and honoured, above
all His other disciples, yet promised to one<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> only a new
name; and, ii., this a name in the highest degree significative,
and most deeply prophetical of a particular office;
and, iii., a name peculiar to Himself, as the immovable
foundation of the Church. This happened in the first year
of His ministry, before, as it would appear, either Peter or
any other apostle was called.</p>

<p>The promise thus emphatically made to Simon, "Thou
shalt be called the Rock," our Lord fulfilled in the second
year of His ministry, when He distinguished the twelve
Apostles from the rest of His disciples, giving them authority
to teach, and power to heal sicknesses and to cast out
devils. Then, says S. Mark "to<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Simon He gave the
name of Peter;" and S. Matthew, "the names of the Twelve
Apostles are these; the first, Simon, who is called Peter;"
and S. Luke, "Simon whom also He named Peter." And
by this name He marked Him out from amongst all his
brethren, and united him to Himself. "He changes, too,"
says Tertullian, "Peter's name from Simon, because also as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>Creator He altered the names of Abraham, Sara, and Oshua,
calling the last Jesus, and adding syllables to the others,
but why did He call him Peter? If for the strength of his
faith, many solid substances would lend him a name from
themselves. Or was it because Christ is both the Rock and
the Stone? Since we read that He is set for a stone of
stumbling and a rock of offence. I omit the rest. And so
it was His pleasure to communicate to the dearest of His
disciples, in a peculiar manner, a name drawn from the
figures of Himself, I imagine, as being nearer than one
drawn from figures not of Himself."<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>It is, then, setting a seal on His former acts, drawing out
and corroborating their meaning, that He once more, and in
the most emphatic way of all, recurs to this name, attaching
to it the most signal promises, and establishing its prophetic
power. In the third year of His ministry our Lord "came
into the quarters of Cesarea Philippi: and He asked His
disciples, saying, Whom do men say that the Son of Man is?
But they said, Some John the Baptist, and others Elias,
and others Jeremias, or one of the prophets. Jesus saith to
them, But whom say ye that I am? Simon Peter answered
and said, Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God. And
Jesus answering, said to him, Blessed art thou Simon Bar
Jonas, because flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee,
but my Father who is in heaven. And I say to thee that
thou art Peter; and upon this rock I will build my Church,
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I
will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And
whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound also in
heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth, it shall
be loosed also in heaven."</p>

<p>When we reflect that the first act of our Lord to Peter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>was to look upon him, and to promise him this name, a
token of His omnipotence to Simon yet knowing him not,
as that seeing him under the fig-tree was to Nathaniel of
His omniscience; and that when He chose His twelve
apostles, it is said markedly "to Simon He gave the name
of Peter," the force of His reply cannot well be exceeded.
The promise of our Lord answers part by part to the confession
of His apostle. The one says: "Thou art the
Christ," that is, the anointed one; the other, "Thou art
Peter," that is, the Rock, the name which I gave thee
myself: my own title with which I invested thee. The one
adds, "the Son of the living God;" the other, "And
upon this rock I will build my Church," that is, as it is true
what thou confessest, that I am "the Son of the living God,"
so my power as such shall be shown in building my Church
upon thee whom I have long named the Rock, "and the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Not only this,
but I will unfold to thee the full meaning of thy name, and
declare the gifts which accompany it. "And<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> I will give to
thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven." That is, "The
root and the offspring of David," "the holy one and the
true one, He that hath the key of David; He that openeth
and no man shutteth; shutteth and no man openeth;" as
He gave to thee to share His name of the Rock, so He shall
give to thee to bear in His name His own symbol of supreme
dominion, the key which opens or shuts the true city of
David; all ages shall own thee, all nations acknowledge
thee, as <i>The Bearer of the Keys</i>; as long as my Church
shall last, against which the gates of hell shall not prevail,
thy office shall last too; as long as there are souls to be
saved, they shall pass by thy ministry into the gate of the
Church. And further, as long as there need in my spiritual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>kingdom laws to be promulgated, precepts issued, sins forgiven,
"whatsoever thou shalt bind upon earth, it shall be
bound also in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven."</p>

<p>Who, indeed, can adequately express the gifts which the
world's Creator and Redeemer here promises to His favoured
servant? Thus in the fourth century S. Chrysostome
labours to set them forth. "See how He raises Peter to a
higher opinion of Himself; and reveals and shews Himself
to be the Son of God by these two promises. For what
belongs to God alone, to loose sins, and to render the Church
immovable in such an assault of waves, and to make a fisherman
more solid than any rock, when the whole world was
at war with him, these are what He promises to give him;
as the Father addressing Jeremias, said: 'I have made
thee an iron pillar and a wall,' but him to one nation,
whereas the other to the whole world. Willingly would I
ask those who wish to diminish the dignity of the Son, which
are the greatest gifts, those which the Father gave to Peter,
or those which the Son. For the Father bestowed on Peter
the revelation of the Son; but the Son disseminated that
of the Father and of Himself through the whole world; and
<i>put into the hands of a mortal man power over all things
in heaven, when He gave the keys to him</i> who extended the
Church through the whole world, and showed it to be firmer
than the heaven."<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> And not many years later S. Leo says,
"That which the Truth ordered remains; and blessed Peter
persisting in that strength of the rock which he received,
has not deserted the guidance, once undertaken, of the
Church. For thus was he set before the rest, that while he is
called the Rock, while he is declared to be the foundation,
while he is appointed the door-keeper of the kingdom of heaven,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>while he is advanced to be the judge of what shall be
bound and what loosed, with the condition that his sentence
shall be ratified even in heaven, <i>we might learn through the
very mysteries of the names given to him, how he was associated
with Christ</i>."<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> This association passed, indeed, into
the very mind of the Church, for among all the titles given
by fathers and councils and liturgies to Peter, and expressing
his prerogatives, the one contained in this name is the most
frequent. Thus he is termed,<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>"the rock of the Church,"<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
"the rock of the Church that was to be built,"<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>"underlying
the building of the Church,"<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>"receiving on himself
the building of the Church,"<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>"the immovable rock,"<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>"the
rock which the proud gates of hell prevail not against," <a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>"the
most solid rock,"<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>"he to whom the Lord granted
the participation of His own title, the rock," <a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>"the
foundation second from Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>"the great foundation
of the Church,"<a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>"the foundation and basis," <a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>"founding
the Church by his firmness,"<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>"the support
of the Church,"<a name="FNanchor_39_40" id="FNanchor_39_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>"the Apostle in whom is the Church's
support,"<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>"the support of the faith,"<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>"the pillar of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>Church," and by an authority sufficient alone to terminate
all controversy, the great Council of Chalcedon,<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> "the
rock and foundation of the Catholic Church, and the basis
of the orthodox faith."<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Thus, then, we have the name of Peter first promised,
next conferred, then explained. And further light will be
shed on this by the consideration of the purpose for which
names in Holy Writ were bestowed by divine command on
individuals, or their former names changed.</p>

<p>Now<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> of names imposed in Scripture there would seem
to be three classes. The first and most common are <i>commemorative</i>,
and are for the purpose of recording and
handing down to posterity remarkable facts. Such are
Peleg, "because in his days the earth was <i>divided</i>;" Isaac,
from the <i>laughter</i> of his father and mother; Issachar, a
<i>reward</i>; Manasseh, "God hath made me to <i>forget</i> my
labours;" Ephraim, "God hath made me to <i>grow</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> and a
multitude of others.</p>

<p>The second class may be termed <i>significative</i>, being imposed
to distinguish their bearers from others by some
quality. Such are Jacob, the supplanter; Esau; Edom,
the red; Moses, the taken or saved; Maccabæus; Boanerges.<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The third and highest class are <i>prophetic</i>, and as such
evidently can be imposed by God alone, who foresees the
future. They are two-fold: i. Those which foresignify
events concerning not so much their bearers as others;
such are Shear-jashub, "the remnant shall return;" Jezrael
"I will visit;" Lo-ruhamah, "not pitied;" Lo-ammi,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>"not my people." ii. Those which point out the office and
destiny of their bearers; such as Noah, rest; Israel, a
prince before God; Joshua, Saviour; Sarah, princess;
John, in whom there is grace; and, after the divine name
of Jesus, "who saves His people from their sins,"<a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Abraham,
and Cephas, or Peter, which two neither commemorate
a past event, nor signify a quality or ornament already
possessed, but are wholly prophetic, inasmuch as they
shadow out the dignity to which the leaders of the two
covenants are divinely marked out by the very imposition
of their name.</p>

<p>For it will perhaps bring out the pre-eminence and
superior authority of Peter, if we consider the very close
resemblance and almost identity of the dispensation into
which God entered with Abraham, and that which Christ
gave to Peter. But first we must observe how the more
remarkable things occurring in the New Testament were
foretold by types, images, parallelisms, and distinct prophecies
in the Old. How<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> both our Lord, the Evangelists,
and the Apostles, take pains to point out the close agreement
between the two covenants; how the ancient ecclesiastical
writers do the like in their contests with early
heretics, or in recommending the truth of the Christian
faith either to Jew or Gentile. They considered scarcely
any proof of the Gospel superior to that which might be
drawn by grave and solid inference from the anticipation
of Christian truths in the old covenant. Now, among such
truths, what concerns Peter is surely of signal importance,
as it affects the whole judgment on the form of government
which our Lord instituted for His Church.</p>

<p>Again, it may be taken as an axiom that, as a similitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>of causes is inferred from a similitude of effects, so a resemblance
of the divine counsels may be inferred from a resemblance
of exterior manifestations. As effects are so many
steps by which we rise to the knowledge and discernment
of causes, so divine manifestations are tokens which unfold
God's eternal decrees. Thus if the series of dealings which
constitute God's dispensation to Abraham be very much like
that other series in which the Scriptures of the New Testament
set forth the dispensation given to Peter, we may
conclude, first, that the two dispensations may be compared,
and, secondly, that from their resemblance, a resemblance
in the divine purpose may be deduced.</p>

<p>First,<a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> then, "God at sundry times, and in divers manners,
speaking to the Fathers" of that covenant of grace,
into which He had already entered with our first parents,
said to Abram, "Go forth out of thy country, and from thy
kindred, and out of thy father's house, and I will make of
thee a great nation." But when in the last days He began
to fulfil that covenant, and to declare His will by His Son,
Jesus said to Simon and Andrew, "Follow me, and I will
make you to become fishers of men," and to Simon specially,
"Fear not, for henceforth thou shalt catch men."<a name="FNanchor_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Abram hearkened to God calling him: "So Abram went
out as the Lord had commanded him;" and Simon as readily
obeyed Christ's vocation: "And immediately leaving their
nets they followed Him."<a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>God rewarded Abraham's obedience by the promise of a
new name: "Neither shall thy name be called any more
Abram, but thou shalt be called Abraham." So Christ
honoured Simon, saying, "Thou art Simon, the son of
Jonas, thou shalt be called Cephas."<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p><p>No sooner had God unfolded the dignity shadowed forth
in the promised name, and bestowed that dignity on Abraham,
than He required of him a signal instance of faith and
love: "God tempted Abraham, and said to him, Take thy
son, thine only begotten, whom thou lovest, and offer him
for a holocaust." So Christ required of Simon a proof of
faith and of superior love before He either unfolded the
excellence of the promised name, or adorned him with that
excellency: "He saith to them, Whom say ye that I am?"
"Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these?"<a name="FNanchor_53_54" id="FNanchor_53_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_54" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>And both were no less ready to show the fortitude of
their faith and love than they had been ready to follow the
divine calling. For, "Abraham stretched forth his hand,
and took the sword to sacrifice his son;" and "Simon Peter
answering, said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God;" and again, "Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love
Thee."<a name="FNanchor_54_55" id="FNanchor_54_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Then, as the bestowal of the new name was the reward
of the obedience with which each had followed his vocation,
so God, moved by their remarkable ensuing faith and
charity, explained the dignity contained in that name, and
bestowed it when so explained. The following refers to the
explanation; "By myself have I sworn, because thou hast
done this thing," and "Because flesh and blood hath not
revealed it to thee, but my Father who is in heaven. And
I say unto thee."</p>

<p>But as to the dignity bestowed, it should be remarked
that it is divine, and communicated to each with this
resemblance: <i>First</i>, that Abraham thereby becomes the
source and parent of all the faithful, and Peter their base
and foundation; the one, the author of a seed which should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>equal in number the stars of the heaven and the sand of the
sea; the other, the Rock of the Church, which should
embrace all nations, tribes, and languages. God says to
Abraham, "And multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the
stars of heaven and as the sand which is on the sea-shore."
But Christ to Peter, "and upon this rock I will build my
Church." <i>Secondly</i>, the blessing thus bestowed from above
upon each was not one which should rest in their single
persons, but from them and through them should be extended
to the universal posterity and society of the faithful;
so that all who should believe, to the consummation of time,
should gain through them blessing, stability, and victory
over the assault of enemies and the gates of hell. The
promise to Abraham is clear: "thy seed shall possess the
gate of their enemies, and in thy seed shall all the nations
of the earth be blessed:" nor less so to Peter, "And the
gates of hell shall not prevail against it."</p>

<p>But the high excellence of this dignity, embracing, as it
does, the whole company of the faithful, was presignified in
the very meaning of the name imposed. For of Abraham's
name we read, "And thy name shall be Abraham, for a
father of many nations have I made thee." Exactly resembling
is what is said of Peter's appellation, "Thou art
Peter, the Rock, and upon this rock I will build my
Church."</p>

<p>Nay, we may put in parallel columns the two promises,
thus&mdash;</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="promises">
<tr><td align="left">1. Thy name shall be</td><td align="left" colspan="2">1. Thou art Peter,</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">Abraham,</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">2. For a father of many</td><td align="left" colspan="2">2. And upon this rock I</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">nations have I made thee:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</td><td align="left" colspan="2">will build my Church.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>And just as in the former, the second clause contains the
reason of the first, so in the latter likewise the two clauses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>cohere, as the name and its explanation. Again, the dignity
of the one is expressed as that of the Father; of the other
as that of the Rock. Further, those alone can share the
blessing of Abraham, who are born of his spirit: and those
alone the stability divinely granted to Peter, who refuse by
any violence, or at any cost, to be separated from him.</p>

<p>But Abraham was thus raised to be the friend of God,
associated in the divine Fathership, and made the teacher
of posterity; and therefore, as being such, God would show
him His counsels, that through him they might descend to
his children. "And the Lord said, Can I hide from
Abraham what I am about to do? for I know that he will
command his children and his household after him to keep
the way of the Lord." In a precisely similar way, when
God would call the Gentiles to the light of the Gospel, He
shewed it by a special revelation to Peter alone: "There
came upon him an ecstasy of mind; and he saw the heaven
opened; and this was done thrice." And the reason of so
preferring Peter was God's decree, that through him all
other Christians, even the Apostles themselves, might be
informed, and convinced. "You know that in former days
God made choice among us that by my mouth the Gentiles
should hear the word of the Gospel and believe." "And
thou, when thou art converted, confirm thy brethren."<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Finally, as God pronounces Abraham blest, so Christ
pronounces Peter; and as He made Abraham the source
and fountain-head of blessing and strength to all others, so
no less did Christ make Peter. Of the first we read, "I
will bless thee, and will make thy name great, and thou
shalt be a blessing;" of the second, "Blessed art thou,
Simon Bar Jonah;&mdash;and upon this rock I will build My
Church."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>
<p>In one word, the parallel is as follows between Abraham
and Peter. Both receive a remarkable call, and follow it;
both are promised and receive a new, and that a prophetical
name; of both signal instances of faith and love are
required; both furnish these, and therefore do not lose the
increase of their reward; to Abraham his prophetical name
is explained, and to Peter likewise; Abraham understands
his destination to be the Father of all nations, and Peter
that he is made the Rock of the universal Church; Abraham
is called blest, and so Peter; to Abraham it is revealed
that no one, save from him, and through him, shall share
the heavenly blessing; to Peter that all, from him, and
through him, shall gain strength and stability; it is only
through Abraham that his posterity can promise itself
victory over the enemy, and only through being built on
Peter, the Rock, that the Church will triumph over the
gates of hell; in fine, if Abraham, as the teacher of the
faithful, is instructed in the divine counsels with singular
care, not less is shown to Peter, whom Christ has made the
doctor and teacher of all believers.</p>

<p>The gifts thus bestowed on Abraham and Peter are
<i>peculiar</i>, for they are read of no one else in the Holy Scriptures;
they are not only <i>gifts</i>, but a <i>reward</i> for singular
merit; and in their own nature they cannot be <i>general</i>. As
by them Abraham is put into a relation of <i>Fathership</i>, so
that all the faithful become his children, so Peter being
called and made the Rock and <i>Foundation</i> of the Church,
all its members have a dependence on him.</p>

<p>And if these gifts are <i>peculiar</i>, no less do they convey a
singular <i>dignity</i> and <i>pre-eminence</i>. For it follows that, as
S. Paul says,<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> that all the faithful are children of Abraham,
being heirs not of his flesh, but of his spirit and faith;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>so no one is, or can be, a part of the Church's building, who
rests not on Peter as the foundation. For the same God
who said to Abraham, "Thy name shall no longer be called
Abram, but Abraham shall be thy name," said also to Simon,
"Thou shalt not be called Simon, but Cephas;" the same
God who said to the former, "In thee shall all families of
the earth be blessed," said to the latter, "Upon this Rock
I will build my Church."</p>

<p>What is the source of this pre-eminence in both? To
both the same objection may be made, and for both the
same defence.</p>

<p>How should blessing and adoption be propagated from
Abraham, as a sort of head, into the whole body of the
faithful? Because Abraham is considered as joined with
that mighty Seed his offspring, whence <i>in chief</i> and <i>primarily</i>
the salvation of all depends; because Abraham is made
by <i>participation</i> partner of that dignity which <i>naturally</i>
and <i>substantially</i> belongs to the Seed that was to spring
from him. God Himself has told us this, and His Apostle
S. Paul explained it. For as we read that it was said to
Abraham, "In thee shall all nations of the earth be blessed,"
so God Himself has told us that <i>in thee, by thee</i>, means
<i>in, by thy seed</i>. Hence S. Paul:<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> "To Abraham were the
promises made, and to his seed. He saith not, seeds, as of
many, but as of one, and to thy seed, which is Christ." So
that the divine words, "In thee shall all nations of the
earth be blessed," give this meaning: "As thou shalt give
flesh to my only begotten Son whom I cherish in my
bosom, whence He shall be called at once 'the Son of God
and the Son of Abraham,'<a name="FNanchor_58_59" id="FNanchor_58_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> so He makes thee a partner of
His dignity and excellence, whence, if not the source and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>origin, yet thou shalt be a broad stream of blessing to be
poured out on all nations."</p>

<p>Now just in the same manner is Peter the Rock of
the Church, and the cause next to Christ of that firmness
with which the Church shall remain impregnable to the
end. For therefore is he the Rock and Foundation of the
Church, because he has been called into a sort of unity
with Him of whom it is said, "Behold I lay in Sion a chief
corner stone, elect, precious, and he that believeth on it
shall not be ashamed:" and in whom, as Paul explains, "the
whole building fitly framed together increaseth unto a holy
temple in the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_59_60" id="FNanchor_59_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Therefore is he the Church's Rock,
because as he, by his own confession, declared the Godhead
of the Foundation in chief, "Thou art the Christ, the
Son of the living God," so from Him, who is the chief
and substantial Foundation, he received the gift of being
made partner in one and the same property: "And I too
say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
will build my Church;" one with Me by communication of
My office and charge, My dignity and excellency. Hence
the stability of Peter is that of Christ, as the splendour of
the ray is that of the sun; Peter's dignity that of Christ,
as the river's abundance is the abundance of the fountain.
Those who diminish Peter's dignity may well be charged
with violating the majesty of Christ; those who are hostile
to Peter, and divorced from him, stand in the like opposition
to Christ.</p>

<p>Now this parallel is an answer<a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> to those who object to
Peter's supereminence as the Foundation, that this dignity
is entirely divine, surpassing by an almost infinite degree
the capacity of man. For is not that a divine dignity
which consists in the paternity of all the faithful? Is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>that prerogative beyond man's capacity by which one
becomes the author of a blessing diffused through all
nations? Yet no one denies that such a dignity and such
a prerogative were granted to Abraham. In divine endowments,
therefore, their <i>full</i> and <i>natural possession</i> must be
carefully distinguished from their <i>limited</i> and <i>analogous
participation</i>. The one, as inherent, cannot fall to the
creature's lot; the other, as transferable, may be granted
as God pleases. For what further removed from man than
the Godhead? Yet it is written, "I have said, ye are
Gods."<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>Not weightier is the other objection, that the office of
being the Foundation is too important to be entrusted to
human care. Was there less difficulty in blessing being
diffused from one man among all nations? Rather we
must look on man not as he is by, and of, himself, apart
from God, and left to his own weakness, but as upborne by
divine power, according to the promise, "Behold, I am with
you all days, until the consummation of the world." Who
can doubt that man, in union with God, may serve for a
foundation, and discharge those offices in which the unity
of a structure consists? It is confidently and constantly
objected, that "other foundation no man can lay beside
that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> As if what
has been laid by Christ Himself, and consists in the
virtue of Christ alone, can be thought other than Christ;
or as if it were unusual, or unscriptural, for things proper
to Christ to be participated by men. Therefore the chief
difficulties against Peter's pre-eminence, and character as
the Foundation, seem to spring from the mind failing to
realise the supernatural order instituted by God, and the
perpetual presence of Christ watching over His Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p><p>Thus it is no derogation to Abraham's being the Father
of the faithful, or to the hierarchy of the Church instituted
by Christ Himself, that our Lord says,<a name="FNanchor_63_64" id="FNanchor_63_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> "Call none your
father upon earth, for one is your Father who is in heaven;"
inasmuch as Scripture abundantly proves that divine gifts
are richly conferred upon men. What more divine than
the Holy Spirit? Yet it is written,<a name="FNanchor_64_65" id="FNanchor_64_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> "And I will ask the
Father, and He shall give you another Paraclete, that He
may abide with you for ever." What a higher privilege
than filial adoption? Yet it is said, <a name="FNanchor_65_66" id="FNanchor_65_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_66" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>"Ye have received
the spirit of filial adoption, by which we cry, Abba Father."
What a greater treasure than co-inheritance with Christ?
Yet we read, <a name="FNanchor_66_67" id="FNanchor_66_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_67" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>"but if children, also heirs: heirs of God,
but joint heirs with Christ." What higher than the vision
of God? Yet S. Paul bears witness,<a name="FNanchor_67_68" id="FNanchor_67_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_68" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> "We see now
through a glass darkly, but then face to face." What
more wonderful than the power of remitting sins? Yet
this very power is granted to the Apostles, <a name="FNanchor_68_69" id="FNanchor_68_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_69" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>"Whose sins
you shall forgive, they are forgiven them." What further
from human weakness than the power of working miracles?
Yet Christ establishes this, <a name="FNanchor_69_70" id="FNanchor_69_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_70" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>"Amen, amen, I say unto
you, he that believeth on Me, the works which I do, shall
he do also, and greater works than these shall he do."
Indeed, the participation and communion of heavenly gifts
have the closest coherence with that supernatural order,
which God in creating man chose, and to which He called
fallen man back through His only begotten Son; with that
dispensation of Christ by which He loved the Apostles as
He Himself was loved by the Father, by which He called
them, <a name="FNanchor_70_71" id="FNanchor_70_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_71" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>"not servants, but friends," and gave them that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>glory which He had Himself received from the Father.
And the tone of mind which denies Peter's prerogative as
the Foundation of the Church, under pretence that it is an
usurpation of divine power, tends to deny some one or all
of the privileges just cited, and, as a fact, does deny some
of them. It is <a name="FNanchor_71_72" id="FNanchor_71_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_72" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>wonderful to see how only common and
vulgar things are discerned by modern eyes, where the
Fathers saw celestial and divine gifts. Those without the
Church have fallen away as well from the several parts and
privileges, from what may be called the standing order, of
the Incarnation, as from its final purpose and scope; and it
is much if they would not charge with blasphemy that glorious
saying put forth by the greatest of the Eastern, as
by the greatest of the Western Fathers, "that God became
man, in order that man might become God."<a name="FNanchor_72_73" id="FNanchor_72_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_73" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>Was, then, S. Chrysostome wrong when he said that our
Lord, in that passage of Matthew, showed a power equal to
God the Father by the gifts which He bestowed on a poor
fisherman? "He who gave to him the keys of the heavens,
and made him Lord of such power, and needed not
prayer for this, for He did not then say, I prayed, but, with
authority, I will build my Church, and I will give to
thee the keys of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_73_74" id="FNanchor_73_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_74" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Was he wrong when he called
him "the chosen of the Apostles, the mouth-piece of the
disciples, the head of the band, the ruler over the brethren?"<a name="FNanchor_74_75" id="FNanchor_74_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_75" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
Or where he saw these prerogatives in the very
name of Peter, observing, "When I say Peter, I mean the
impregnable rock, the immovable foundation, the great
apostle, the first of the disciples?"<a name="FNanchor_75_76" id="FNanchor_75_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_76" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p><p>To sum up, then, what has been hitherto said, we have advanced
so far as this; first the promise, and then the bestowal
of a new name, expressing a singular pre-eminence, and in
its <i>proper</i> sense befitting Christ alone, have distinguished
Simon from the rest of the apostles. But much more the
power signified by that name, and explained by the Lord
Himself, carries far higher Peter's privilege, and indicates
him to be the possessor of authority over the Apostles. For
if Simon is the Rock of the Church, and if the property of
Foundation, on which the structure of the Church rests,
belongs to him immediately after Christ, and analogously
with Christ, there arises this relation between Christ and
Simon, that as He is first, and chiefly, and by inherent
power, so Simon is secondarily, by participation and
analogy, that which underlies, holds together, and supports
the Apostles and the whole fabric of the Church.</p>

<p>Now such a relation carries with it not merely precedency
of honour, but superior authority. The strength of
the Apostles lay in their union with Christ, and subordination
to Him. The like necessity of adhering to Peter is expressed
in his new name. Take away that subordination, and you
destroy the very image by which the Lord chose to express
Peter's dignity; and you remove, likewise, Peter's participation
in that property which the Lord communicated to
him in the name of the Rock. For if the Apostles needed
not to be joined with him, he had no title to be called the
Foundation; and if he had no coactive power over the
Apostles, he did not share the property by which Christ is
the Rock and Foundation. Thus the name, and the dignity
expressed by the name, show Peter to have been singly
invested by the Lord with both honour and power superior
to all the Apostles.<a name="FNanchor_76_77" id="FNanchor_76_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_77" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<h3>EDUCATION AND FINAL DESIGNATION OF PETER TO BE THE
RULER WHO SHOULD CONFIRM HIS BRETHREN.</h3>


<p>Having promised<a name="FNanchor_1_78" id="FNanchor_1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_78" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and bestowed on Simon a new name,
prophetic of the peculiar position which he was to occupy in
the Church, and having set forth the meaning contained in
that name in terms so large and magnificent, that, as we
have seen, the greatest saints and fathers have felt it
impossible to exhaust their force, our Lord proceeded to
<i>educate</i> Peter, so to say, for his especial charge of supreme
ruler. He bestowed upon him, in the course of His ministry,
tokens of preference which agree with the title thus
solemnly conferred; and He instructed him with all the
care which we should expect to be given to one who was to
become the chief doctor of Christians. Such instruction
may be said to consist in two things, a more complete
knowledge of the Christian revelation, and a singular apprehension
of its divine proofs.</p>

<p>Now, innumerable as are the particulars in which the
Christian revelation consists, they may yet be gathered up
mainly into two points, which meet in the Person of our Lord,
and are termed by the ancient fathers who have followed
this division, the <i>Theology</i>, and the <i>Economy</i>. There
is the Divine Nature, that "<i>form of God</i>," which our Lord
had from the beginning in the bosom of the Father; and
there is the human nature, that "<i>form of a servant</i>,"
which "in the economy or dispensation of the fulness of
times" He assumed, in order that He might purchase the
Church with His blood, and<a name="FNanchor_2_79" id="FNanchor_2_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_79" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "re-establish all things in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>heaven and on earth." All, therefore, in the Christian faith
which concerns "the form of God" is termed the Theology;
all which contemplates "<i>the form of a servant</i>," the
Economy.</p>

<p>But the heavenly origin and certain truth of both these
parts of Christian faith are proved partly by the fulfilment
of prophecy, and partly by the working of miracles. To
both our Lord perpetually appealed, and His apostles after
Him, and those who have followed them. One, then, who
was to be the chief ruler and doctor of Christians, needed
especial instruction in the Theology, and Economy, especial
assurance of the fulfilment of prophecy, and the working of
miraculous power. Now Peter was specially selected for
this instruction and that assurance.</p>

<p>The whole teaching of our Lord, indeed, and the innumerable
acts of power and words of grace with which it was
fraught, were calculated to convey these to all the Apostles.
But while they were witnesses in common of that teaching
in general, some parts of it were disclosed only to Peter and
the two sons of Zebedy. Perhaps there is no incident in
the Gospel history, which set forth in so lively a manner,
and so convincingly proved, the mysteries concerning the
union of "the form of God" and "the form of a servant,"
as the Transfiguration. The retreat to the "high mountain
apart," and in the midst of that solitary prayer, "the
face shining as the sun," and "the robes white as light,"
the presence of Moses and Elias, conversing with Him on
the great sacrifice for sin, "the bright cloud which encompassed
them," and the voice from out of it, proclaiming
"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased:
hear Him;" so impressed themselves on the great Apostle,
that after long years he appealed to them in proof that
he and his brethren had not taught "cunningly devised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
fables, when they made known the power and presence of
the Lord Jesus Christ, but had been eyewitnesses of His
majesty, when He received from God the Father honour
and glory, this voice coming down to Him from the excellent
glory, 'This is my beloved Son, in whom I have pleased
myself: hear ye Him.' And this voice we heard brought
from heaven, when we were with Him in the holy mount."
Among all the Apostle's experience of the three years' ministry,
by the shore and on the waves of the lake of Galilee,
in the cornfields, or on the mountain side, in the noon-day
heat, or midnight storm, even in the throng which cried
'Hosannah!' and 'Crucify Him!' this stood out, until
"the laying aside of his fleshly tabernacle," as "the Lord
had signified to Him."<a name="FNanchor_3_80" id="FNanchor_3_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_80" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> For<a name="FNanchor_4_81" id="FNanchor_4_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_81" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> what indeed was not there?
the plurality of persons in the Godhead, the Father and
the Son, the true, and not adopted, Sonship of the latter,
His divine mission unto men; the new order of things resulting
from it, and the summing up under one head of all
things in heaven and in earth; the sealing up and accomplishing
of the law and the prophets, by the presence of
their representatives, Moses and Elias, a most wonderful
and transporting miracle; and the command implicitly to
obey Him in whom the Father was well pleased. Thus the
Transfiguration may be termed the summing up of the
whole Christian revelation.</p>

<p>But now of this we read that "after six days Jesus taketh
unto Him <i>Peter</i>, and James, and John his brother, and
bringeth them up into a high mountain apart." These
three alone of the twelve. Yet does He not associate the
sons of Zebedy with Peter in this privilege? Needful no
doubt it was that so splendid an act should have a suitable
number of witnesses, and that as His future glory should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>have<a name="FNanchor_5_82" id="FNanchor_5_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_82" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> three witnesses from heaven, and as many from
earth, so this, its rudimental beginning, should be attested
by three as from heaven, God the Father, Moses, and
Elias, and by three from earth, Peter, James, and John.
Dear to Him likewise, next to Peter, and most privileged
after Peter, were the sons of Zebedy; yet a distinction is
seen in the mode in which they are treated even when
joined together in so great a privilege. For in all the
three accounts Peter is named first; "He taketh to Him
Peter, and James, and John." They likewise are called by
their birth-name, he by his prophetic appellation of the
Rock; they are silent, but he speaks; "Peter answering,
said;" nor only speaks, but in the name of all; "It is good
<i>for us</i> to be here," as if their leader. And, fifthly, he is
named specially, they as his companions; "but Peter, <i>and
they that were with him</i>, were heavy with sleep."<a name="FNanchor_6_83" id="FNanchor_6_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_83" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Thus
even when three are associated in a special privilege above
the Twelve, Peter is distinguished among the three.</p>

<p>But if there was one other occasion on which above all
"the form of the servant" was to be set forth in the most
awful, and the most endearing light, it was on that evening,
"the hour" of evil men and "the power of darkness,"
when "the righteous servant who should justify many"
was about to perform the great, central, crowning act of
His mediation. Then we read that "He said to His disciples,
Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray."<a name="FNanchor_7_84" id="FNanchor_7_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_84" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> And then
immediately "taking with Him Peter, and the two sons of
Zebedy, He began to grow sorrowful and to be sad." Yet
here again, even in the association with the sons of Zebedy,
Simon is distinguished, for he is named first; and by the
illustrious name of Peter, the Rock; and as the leader of
the others, for, says Matthew, Christ after His first prayer,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>"comes to His disciples, and finds them sleeping, and <i>says to
Peter</i>, What, could <i>ye</i> not watch with me one hour?" Why
the change of number, Peter in the singular, <i>ye</i> in the
plural? Why the blame of Peter, involving the blame of
the rest? Because the members are censured in the
head.</p>

<p>In these two signal instances our Lord, while preferring
Peter and the two sons of Zebedy to the rest of the Twelve,
yet marks a gradation likewise between them and Peter.
And these two set forth the Theology and Economy, in the
most emphatic manner.</p>

<p>And as the supreme preceptor must not only be acquainted
with the truth which he has to deliver, but with
the evidence on which it rests, so is Peter specially made a
witness of his Lord's "power and presence" and "the works
which no other man did." In that remarkable miracle of
raising to life the ruler of the synagogue's daughter we
read, "He admitted not any man to follow Him, but Peter
and James, and John the brother of James;"<a name="FNanchor_8_85" id="FNanchor_8_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_85" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> where, as
before, and always, Peter is mentioned first, and by the
prophetic name of his Primacy.</p>

<p>From<a name="FNanchor_9_86" id="FNanchor_9_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_86" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> all which we gather four points; 1. Several
things are mentioned in the Gospels which Christ gave to
Peter, and not to the rest of the Apostles: 2. But nothing
which He gave to them together, and not to Peter with
them. 3. What He seemed to give to them in common, yet
accrue to Peter in a special manner, who appears among
the Apostles not as one out of the number, but their destined
head, by the name, that is, of Peter, so markedly
promised, bestowed, and wonderfully explained by our
Lord, of which, as we have seen, S. Chrysostome, an eastern
Patriarch, as well as a great Saint and Father, observed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>"When I say Peter, I mean the impregnable Rock, the immovable
foundation, the great Apostle, the first of the
disciples." 4. Either we are not to take Christ's dealing
as the standard of Peter's dignity, and destination, or we
must admit that he was preferred to the rest, and made the
supreme teacher of the faithful.</p>

<p>S. Matthew records the incidents of the officers asking
for the payment of the didrachma which all the children of
Israel were bound to contribute to the temple; and his
words show us a fresh instance of honour done to Peter, and
a fresh note of his superiority. "When they were come to
Capharnaum, they that received the didrachma came to
Peter and said to him, Doth not your master pay the
didrachma?"<a name="FNanchor_10_87" id="FNanchor_10_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_87" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> But why should they come to <i>him</i>, and
ask, not if <i>his</i> master, but "your" master, the master of all
the Apostles, paid the census, save that it was apparent,
even to strangers, that Peter was the first and most prominent
of the company? Why use him rather than any of
the others, for the purpose of approaching Christ? "As
Peter seemed to be first of the disciples," says S. Chrysostome,
on the text, "they go to him." The context naturally
suggests this reason, and the ancient commentators remarked
it. But what follows is much more striking.
Peter answered, Yes, that is, that his master observed all
the laws of Moses, and this among the number. As he
went home he purposed, no doubt, to ask our Lord about
this payment, but "when he was come into the house Jesus
prevented him," having in His omniscience seen and heard
all that had passed, and He proceeded to speak words
involving His own high dignity, followed by a singular trial
of Peter's faith, and as marked a reward of it when tried.
"What thinkest thou, Simon? The kings of the earth, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>whom do they receive tribute or custom? of their own children
or of strangers? And he said, Of strangers. Jesus
said to him, Then the children are free." Slight words in
seeming, yet declaring in fact that most wonderful truth
which had formed so shortly before Peter's confession, and
drawn down upon him the yet unexhausted promise; for
they expressed, I am as truly the natural Son of that God,
the Sovereign of the temple, for whom this tribute is paid,
as the children of earthly sovereigns, who take tribute, are
their sons by nature. Therefore by right I am free.
"But that we may not scandalize them, go to the sea and
cast in a hook; and that fish which shall first come up,
take; and when thou hast opened its mouth, thou shalt find
a stater; take that and give it to them for Me and thee."
Declaring to His favoured disciple afresh that He is the true,
and not the adopted, Son of God, answering his thoughts
by anticipation, and expressing His knowledge of absent
things by the power of the Son of God, He tries his faith
by the promise of a fresh miracle, which involved a like
exercise of divine power. Peter, in proceeding to execute
His command, must make that confession afresh by deed,
which he had made before by word, and which his Lord
had just repeated with His own mouth. How else could he
go to the lake expecting to draw at the first cast a fish in
whose mouth he should find a coin containing the exact
amount due to the temple for two persons? But what followed?
What but a most remarkable reward for the faith
which he should show? "Take that and give it to them
for Me and thee." There are looks, there are tones of the
voice, which convey to us more than language. So, too,
there are acts so exceedingly suggestive, that without in any
<i>formal</i> way proving, they carry with them the force of the
strongest proof. And so, perhaps, never did our Lord in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
more marked manner <i>associate</i> Peter with Himself than
here. It was a singular distinction which could not fail to
strike every one who heard it. Thus S. Chrysostome exclaims,<a name="FNanchor_11_88" id="FNanchor_11_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_88" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
"You see the exceeding greatness of the honour;"
and he adds, "wherefore, too, in reward for his faith He
connected him with Himself in the payment of the tribute;"
and he remarks on Peter's modesty, "for Mark, the disciple
of Peter, seems not to have recorded this incident, because
it pointed out the great honour bestowed on him; but he
did record his denial, while he was silent as to the points
which made him conspicuous, his Master perhaps begging
him not to say great things about him." Indeed, <i>how</i> could
one of the disciples be more signally pointed out than by
this incident, as "the faithful and wise steward, whom the
Lord would set over His household, to give them their portion
of food in due time?"</p>

<p>Other fathers, as well as S. Chrysostome, did not fail to
see such a meaning in this passage; but let us take the
words of Origen as pointing out the connection of this incident
with the important question following. His words are:
"It seems to me that (the disciples) considering this a very
great honour which had been done to Peter by Jesus, in
having put him higher than the rest of His disciples, they
wished to make sure of what they suspected by asking
Jesus and hearing His answer, whether, as they conceived,
He judged Peter to be greater than them; and they also
hoped to learn the cause for which Peter was preferred to
the rest of the disciples. Matthew, then, wishing to signify
this by these words, "take that and give it to them
for Me and thee," added, "on that day the disciples came
to Jesus, saying, Who, thinkest thou, is the greater in the
kingdom of heaven?"<a name="FNanchor_12_89" id="FNanchor_12_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_89" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p><p>For, indeed, why should they immediately ask this
question? The preceding incident furnishes a natural and
sufficient cause. The Apostles, it seems, were urged by
the plainness of Christ's words and acts to inquire who
among them should have the chief authority. Who will
not agree with S. Chrysostome: "The Apostles were
touched with a human infirmity, which the Evangelist too
signifies in the words, 'in that hour,' when He had
honoured him (Peter) before them all. For though of
James and John one of the two was the first-born,"
(alluding to an opinion that the tax was paid by the first-born,)
"He did nothing like it for them. Hence, being
ashamed, they confessed their excitement of mind, and
do not say plainly, Why hast thou preferred Peter to us?
Is he greater than we are? For this they did not dare;
but they ask indefinitely, Who is the greater? For when
they saw three preferred to the rest, they felt nothing
like this; but when one received so great an honour, they
were pained. Nor were they kindled by this alone, but
by putting together many other things. For He had
said to him, 'I will give to thee the keys,' and 'Blessed
art thou Simon Bar-jona,' and here 'Give it to them for
Me and for thee;' and also they were pricked at seeing
his confidence and freedom of speech."<a name="FNanchor_13_90" id="FNanchor_13_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_90" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Thus their question, if it did not express, at least
suggested this meaning, "Speak more plainly and distinctly
whether Peter is to be the greater and the chief in the
Church, and accordingly among us," and so they seem to
have drawn from our Lord's act a conclusion which they
did not see in the promising or bestowing the prophetic
name of Peter, nor even in the promises conveyed in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>explaining that name, and were vexed at the preference
shown to him.</p>

<p>And if <a name="FNanchor_14_91" id="FNanchor_14_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_91" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>any be inclined to conclude from hence that
our Lord's words and acts to Peter had not been of any
marked significancy, they should be reminded that the
very clearest and plainest things were sometimes not
understood by the Apostles, before the descent of the
Holy Spirit on them. This was specially the case with
the things which they were disinclined to believe. Thus
our Lord again and again foretold to them His passion
in express terms, but we are told, "they understood none
of these things."<a name="FNanchor_15_92" id="FNanchor_15_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_92" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> He foretold, too, His resurrection,
yet they did not the least expect it, and they became
at length fully assured of the fact before they remembered
the prediction. Strange as these things seem, yet
probably everyone's private experience will furnish him
with similar instances of a veil being cast upon his eyes,
which prevented his discerning the most evident things,
towards which there was generally some secret disinclination.</p>

<p>But <a name="FNanchor_16_93" id="FNanchor_16_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_93" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>how did our Lord answer their question? Did
He remove at once the ground of their jealousy by declaring
that in the kingdom of heaven no one should
have pre-eminence of dignity, but the condition of all be
equal? On the contrary, He condemns ambition and
enjoins humility, but likewise gives such a turn to His
discourse as to insinuate that there would be one pre-eminent
over the rest.<a name="FNanchor_17_94" id="FNanchor_17_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_94" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> "Jesus calling unto Him a little
child, set him in the midst of them, and said, Amen I
say unto you, unless you be converted and become as
little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>heaven." Then He adds, "whosoever therefore shall humble
himself as this little child, he is the greater in the kingdom
of heaven." Thus He did not exclude the pre-eminence
of that "greater one," about which they asked, but pointed
out what his character ought to be. But this will be
much clearer from a like enquiry, and the answer to it,
recorded by S. Luke.</p>

<p>For even at the last supper, our Lord having told them
that He should be betrayed, and was going to leave them
in the way determined for Him, there was not only an
enquiry among them which of them should do that thing,
but also, so keenly were their minds as yet, before the
coming down of the Holy Spirit, alive to the desire of pre-eminence,
and so strongly were they persuaded that such
a superior had not been excluded by Christ, but rather
marked out and ordained, "there was a strife among them
which of them should seem to be greater." Now our Lord
meets their contention thus: "The <a name="FNanchor_18_95" id="FNanchor_18_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_95" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>kings of the Gentiles
lord it over them, and they that have power over
them are called beneficent. But you not so; but he that
is the greater among you, let him become as the younger;
and he that is the leader, as he that serveth. For which is
greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is not
he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you as
he that serveth. And you are they who have continued
with Me in my temptations; and I dispose to you, as My
Father hath disposed to Me, a kingdom; that you may eat
and drink at My table in My kingdom; and may sit upon
thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."</p>

<p>Now <a name="FNanchor_19_96" id="FNanchor_19_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_96" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>in this speech of our Lord we may remark four
points:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p><p>1. What is omitted, though it would seem most apposite
to be said;</p>

<p>2. What is affirmed, if not expressly, yet by plain consequence;</p>

<p>3. What comparison is used in illustration;</p>

<p>4. What meets with censure and rejection.</p>

<p>1. First, then, though the Apostles had twice before
contended about pre-eminence, yet our Lord neither there,
nor here, said openly that He would not prefer any one over
the rest, nor appoint any one to be their leader. Yet the
importance of the subject, His own wisdom, and His love
towards His disciples, as well as His usual mode of acting,
seemed to demand, that had it been His will for no one of
them to be set over the rest, He should plainly declare it,
and thus extinguish all strife. No less a matter was at
issue than the harmony of the Apostles with each other,
the peace of the Church, and the success of the divine
counsel for its government. Moreover, the Gospels represent
Him to us as continually removing doubts, clearing up
perplexities, and correcting wrong judgments among His
disciples. Let us recall to remind a very similar occasion,
when the mother of the sons of Zebedy with her children
came before Him asking "that these my two sons may sit
the one on thy right hand and the other on thy left, in thy
kingdom." He rejected their prayer at once, saying, "To
sit on My right or My left hand is not mine to give to you,
but to them for whom it is prepared by My Father."<a name="FNanchor_20_97" id="FNanchor_20_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_97" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> The
silence, therefore, of Christ here, under such circumstances,
is a proof that it was not the divine will that all the Apostles
should be in such a sense equal that no one of them
should hold a superior authority over the rest.</p>

<p>2. But eloquent as this silence is, we are not left to trust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>to it alone, for our Lord's words point out, besides, the
institution of one superior. "The kings of the Gentiles,"
He says, "lord it over them; and they that have power
over them are called benefactors. But you not so: but he
that is the greater among you, let him become as the
younger; and he that is the leader, as he that serveth."
<i>A greater</i> and <i>a leader</i>, then, <i>there was to be</i>. Our Lord's
words contain two parallel propositions repeated. 1. There
is among you one who is the greater, let him, then, be as
the younger. 2. There is among you one who is the
leader, let him be as he that serveth. Thus our Lord's
meaning is most distinct that they should have a superior.</p>

<p>But in the very similar passage about the sons of
Zebedy, lest any should conclude that no one of the
Apostles was to be superior to the rest, He called them to
Him and said, "You know that the princes of the Gentiles
lord it over them, and they that are the greater exercise
power upon them. It shall not be so among you, but whosoever
will be the greater among you, let him be your
minister; and he that will be the first among you shall be
your servant. Even as the Son of man is not come to be
ministered unto, but to minister, and to give His life a
redemption for many." Where He tells them His will, not
that no one of the Apostles should be "great" and "first,"
but what the type and model should be which that "great"
and "first" one should imitate, even the Son of man who
came to minister.</p>

<p>3. For to make this quite certain, there, and here too,
He directs us to a particular comparison, by which He
explains and concludes His discourse, "For who is greater,
he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is not he that
sitteth at table? But I am among you as he that serveth.&mdash;And
I dispose unto you as My Father disposed unto Me, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
kingdom." Here our Lord sets Himself before His Apostles
as the exemplar both of the rule which the superior was to
exercise, and of the temper and character which he was to
shew. As He had been speaking of the kingdoms of the
Gentiles, so He now points out to them in contrast the true
kingdom which He was disposing unto them. The Church
as it had been from the beginning, was to be the model of
what it should be to the end. Now all confess that in that
Church Christ had held the place of "the First," "the
Great one," "the Ruler." And now He explains that one
of His Apostles should occupy that place of His, and occupying
it should be of a like temper with Himself, who had
been the minister and servant of all. And it may be
remarked that the same word is here applied to him who
should <i>rule</i> among the disciples, which expresses the dignity
of Christ Himself in the prophecy of Micah, quoted in Matt.
ii. 6, "Out of thee shall go forth<a name="FNanchor_21_98" id="FNanchor_21_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_98" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> <i>the ruler</i>, who shall be
shepherd over my people Israel." For Christ says, "He
that is the greater among you let him be as the younger;
and <i>he that ruleth</i> as he that serveth. <i>For</i>, who is greater,
he that sitteth at meat, or he who serveth?  But I am
among you as he that serveth." "I dispose to you a kingdom:
as My Father disposed to Me:" let him who follows
Me in place, follow Me in character.</p>

<p>But, 4, what does our Lord censure and reject from His
Church? It is plain that He compares kingdom with kingdom,
and the kingdom of heaven, which is the Church, with
human kingdoms, and, moreover, that the negative quality
as to which, in the clause, "But you not so," the two are
compared, is, <i>not</i> the fact that there is pre-eminence and
rule in both, but a certain <i>mode</i> of exercising them. This
is, the pomp and ambition expressed in the words, "lording
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>it," "exercising authority," "are called benificent." As
again is shewn in the repeated declaration that what had
been most alien from the spirit of His own ministry, should
not appear in the ministry that He would establish after
Him. Now He had shown no pomp and pride of dominion,
but yet He had shown the dominion itself in the fullest
sense, the power of passing laws, enjoining precepts, defining
rites, threatening punishments, governing, in fine, His
Church, so that He had been pre-eminently "the Lord."
Lastly, this is shown in the words recorded by S. John,
as said shortly after on this same occasion. "You call Me
Master and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then,
your Lord and Master, have washed your feet, you also
ought to wash one another's feet: <i>for I have given you an
example</i>, that as I have done unto you, so you also may
do."<a name="FNanchor_22_99" id="FNanchor_22_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_99" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Now nothing can show more strongly than this discourse
the pre-eminence and authority which our Lord was going
to establish in one of His Apostles over the rest. For here
we have His intention disclosed that in His kingdom, which
is the Church's, some one there should be "the Great,"
"the First," and "the Ruler," who should discharge, in due
proportion and analogy, the office which He Himself, before
He returned to the Father, had held. But before we consider
further who this one was, let us look at the subject
from a somewhat different point of view.</p>

<p>And <a name="FNanchor_23_100" id="FNanchor_23_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_100" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>here we must lay down three points, the <i>first</i> of
which is, that our Lord, during His life on earth, had acted
in two capacities, the one, as the Author and Founder, the
other, as the Head and Supreme Ruler of His Church.
His functions in the former capacity are too plain to need
enlarging upon. He disclosed the objects of our faith: He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>instituted rites and sacraments: He provided by the
establishment of a ministry for the perpetual growth and
duration of the Church. It was in this sense that He
spoke of Himself to His apostles, as "the Master," who
could share His prerogatives with no one: "But be not
you called Rabbi, for one is your Master, and all you are
brethren."<a name="FNanchor_24_101" id="FNanchor_24_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_101" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Thus is He, "the Teacher," "the Master,"
throughout the Gospel.</p>

<p>But He likewise acted as the Head of His Church, with
the dignity and authority of the chief visible Ruler. He
was the living bond of His disciples: the person around
whom they grouped: whose presence wrought harmony:
whose voice terminated contention among them: who was
ever at hand to solve emergent difficulties. Thus it is that
prophecy distinguished Him as "the Lord," "the King,"
"the Shepherd;" "on whose shoulders is the government,"
"who should <i>rule</i> His people, Israel." And His Church
answers to Him in this capacity, as the family, the house,
the city, the fold, and the kingdom.</p>

<p>Thus His relation to the Church was twofold, as Founder,
and as Supreme Pastor.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, the Church shares her Lord's prerogative of
unchangeableness, and as He is "Jesus Christ the same
yesterday, to-day, and for ever," so She, His mystical
Body, in her proportion, remains like herself from the
beginning to the end. The Church and Christianity are
bound to each other in a mutual relation; the Church is
Christianity embodied; Christianity is the Church in conception:
the consistency and identity which belong to
Christianity belong likewise to her; neither can change
their nature, nor put on another form.</p>

<p>But, <i>thirdly</i>, the Church would be unlike herself, if,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>having been from her very cradle visibly administered by
the rule of One, she fell subsequently, either under no rule
at all, according to the doctrine of the Independents, or
under the rule of the multitude, according to the Calvinists,
or under the rule of an aristocracy, as Episcopalians
imagine. A change of government superinduces a change
of that substantial form which constitutes a society. But
this holds in her case especially, above all other societies,
as she came forth from the creative hand of her Lord, her
whole organization instinct with inward life, her government
<i>directly</i> instituted by God Himself, in which lies her
point of distinction from all temporal polities.</p>

<p>For imagine, that upon our Lord's departure, no one had
been deputed to take the visible headship and rule over
the Church. How, without ever fresh revelations, and an
abiding miraculous power, could that complex unity of
faith, of worship, and of polity, have been maintained,
which the<a name="FNanchor_25_102" id="FNanchor_25_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_102" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Lord has set forth as the very sign and token
of His Church? A multitude scattered throughout the
most distant regions, and naturally differing in race, in
habits, in temperament, how could it possibly be joined in
one, and remain one, without a powerful bond of unity?
Hence, in the fourth century, S. Jerome<a name="FNanchor_26_103" id="FNanchor_26_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_103" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> observed, "The
safety of the Church depends on the dignity of the supreme
Priest, in whom, if all do not recognise a peculiar and
supereminent power, there will arise as many schisms in
the Church as there are priests." And the repentant confessors
out of Novatian's schism, in the middle of the third
century, "We know that Cornelius (the Pope) has been
elected Bishop of the most holy Catholic Church, by
Almighty God, and Christ our Lord.&mdash;We are not ignorant
that there is one God, one Christ the Lord, whom we confessed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>one Holy Spirit, and that there ought to be one
bishop in the Catholic Church."<a name="FNanchor_27_104" id="FNanchor_27_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_104" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>  And these words,
both of S. Jerome, and of the confessors, if they primarily
apply to the diocesan bishop among his priests and people,
so do they with far greater force apply to the chief bishop
among his brethren in the whole Church. Now, as our Lord
willed that His Church should do without fresh revelations,
and new miracles, such as at first accredited it, and that it
should preserve unity; and as, when it was a little flock,
which could be assembled in a single room, it had yet one
visible Ruler, how can we doubt that He willed this form of
government to remain, and that there should be one perpetually
to rule it in His name, and preserve it in unity,
since it was to become co-extensive with the earth?</p>

<p>Again, we may ask, was the condition of fold, house,
family, city, and kingdom, so repeatedly set forth in Holy
Scripture, to belong to the Church only while Christ was
yet on earth, or to be the visible evidence of its truth for
ever? Do these terms exhibit a temporary, or a perpetual
state? Each one of these symbols by itself, and all
together, involve one visible Ruler: therefore, so long as
the Church can be called with truth, the one house, the
one family, the one city, the one fold, the one kingdom, so
long must it have one visible and supreme Ruler.</p>

<p>But once grant that such a one there was after our
Lord's departure, and no one can doubt that one to have
been Peter. It is easier to deny the supreme Ruler
altogether, than to make him any one but Peter. The
whole course of the Gospels shows none other marked out
by so many distinctions. Thus, even those who wish to
refuse a real power to his Primacy, are compelled by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>force of evidence to allow him a Primacy of order and
honour.</p>

<p>But nothing did our Lord more pointedly reject than the
vain pomp of titles and honours. In nothing is His own
example more marked than in that He exercised real power
and supreme authority without pomp or show. Nothing
did He enjoin more emphatically on the disciple who should
be the "Great one," and "the Ruler," among his brethren,
than that he must follow his Master in being the servant of
all. A Primacy, then, consisting in titles and mere precedency,
is of all things most opposed to the spirit and the
precepts of our Lord. And so the Primacy which He
designated must be one of real power and pre-eminent
authority.</p>

<p>And this brings us back to the passage of S. Luke which
we were considering, where four things prove that Christ
had such a headship in view. First, the occasion, for the
Apostles were contending for a place of real authority.
The sons of Zebedy expressed it by sitting on His right
hand and on His left, that is, holding the second and the
third place of dignity in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Secondly, the double comparison which our Lord used,
the one negative, the other affirmative: in the former, contrasting
the Church's ruler with the kings of the Gentiles,
He excluded pomp and splendour, lordship and ambition;
in the latter, referring him to His own example, who had
the most real and true power and superiority, He taught
him to unite these with a meekness and an attention to the
wants of his brethren, of which His own life had been the
model.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the words "the First," "the Greater," and "the
Ruler," indicate the pre-eminence of the future head, for as
they appear in the context, and according to their Scriptural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
force, they indicate not a vain and honorary, but a
real authority, one of them being even the very title given
to our Lord.</p>

<p>And, fourthly, this is proved by the object in view, which
is, maintaining the identity of the Church, and the form
which it had from the beginning, and preserving its manifold
unity. As to its identity, and original form, it is needless
to observe that Christ exercised in it not an honorary
but a real supremacy, so that under Him its government
was really in the hands of one, the Ruler. As to the preservation
of its unity&mdash;and especially a unity so complex&mdash;the
very analogy of human society will sufficiently teach us
that it is impossible to be preserved without a strong
central authority. Contentions can neither be checked as
they arise, nor terminated when they come to a head, without
the interference of a power to which all yield obedience.
And the living example of those religious societies which
have not this power is an argument whose force none can
resist. Where Peter is not, there is neither unity of faith,
nor of charity, nor of external regimen.</p>

<p>No sooner <a name="FNanchor_28_105" id="FNanchor_28_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_105" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>then had our Lord in this manner pointed
out that there should be one hereafter to take His place on
earth and to be the Ruler of his brethren, expressing at
the same time the toilsome nature of the trust, and the
duty of exercising it with the spirit which He, the great
model, had shown, than turning His discourse from the
Apostles, whom hitherto He had addressed in common, to
Peter singly, He proceeded to designate Peter as that one,
to assure him of a singular privilege, and to enforce upon
him a proportionate duty.</p>

<p>And first a break in the hitherto continuous discourse is
ushered in by the words, "And the Lord said," and what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>follows is fixed to Peter specially, by the reiteration of his
name, "Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have
you that he may sift you as wheat:" to have <i>you</i>, that is
not Peter alone, but all the Apostles, the same you, whom
in the preceding verses He had so often repeated, "you not
so," "but I am in the midst of you," "but you are they
that have continued with Me," "and I dispose to you a
kingdom," "that you may eat and drink with Me;" and
what follows? What was the resource provided by the
Lord against this attack of the great enemy on all His fold?
"But I have prayed for <i>thee</i>, that <i>thy</i> faith fail not: and
thou being once converted confirm thy brethren." Not "I
have prayed for <i>you</i>," where all were assaulted, "that <i>your</i>
faith fail not," but I have prayed for <i>thee</i>, Peter, that <i>thy</i>
faith fail not! Nothing can be more emphatic than this
change of number, when our Lord throughout all His previous
discourse had used the plural, and now continuing the
plural to designate the persons attacked, uses the singular
to specify the person for whom He has prayed, and to whom
He assures a singular privilege, the fruit of that prayer.
Nothing could more strongly prove that this address was
special to Peter.</p>

<p>Nor less evident is the singular dignity of what is here
promised to him. First of all, it is the fruit of the prayer
of Christ. Of what importance must that be which was
solicited by our Lord of His Father, and at a moment when
the redemption of the world was being accomplished, and
when His passion may be said to have begun? Of what
importance that which was to be the defence of not Peter
only, but all the disciples, against the most formidable
assault of the great enemy, who had<a name="FNanchor_29_106" id="FNanchor_29_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_106" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> demanded them as
it were to deliver them over to punishment? And this was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>"that thy faith fail not." How is it possible to draw any
other conclusion here than what S. Leo in the fifth century
expressed so clearly before all the bishops of Italy? "The
danger from the temptation of fear was common to all the
Apostles, and all equally needed the help of the divine protection,
since the devil desired to dismay all, to crush all;
and yet a special care of Peter is undertaken by our Lord,
and He prays peculiarly for the faith of Peter, as if the
state of the rest would be more sure, if the mind of their
chief were not conquered. In Peter, therefore, the fortitude
of all is protected, and the help of divine grace is so
ordered, that the firmness which through Christ is given to
Peter, through Peter is conferred on the Apostles."<a name="FNanchor_30_107" id="FNanchor_30_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_107" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And
if such is the importance of the help secured, no less is the
charge following: "And thou, being once converted, confirm
thy brethren." To confirm others, is to be put in an
office of dignity and authority over them. And his brethren
were those whom our Lord till now had been addressing in
common with him; to whom He had just disclosed "a
Greater" and "a Ruler" "among" them; that is, the Apostles
themselves. Among these, then, when our Lord's visible
presence was withdrawn, Peter was to be the principle
of stability, binding and moulding them into one building.
For one cannot fail to see how this great promise and prophecy
answer to those in Matthew. There our Lord, as
Architect, promised to lay Peter as the foundation of the
Church, against which the gates of hell should not prevail:
here, being about to leave the world, when His own work
was finished, to ascend unto His Father, and to assume His
great power and reign, He makes Peter as it were the
Architect to carry on the work which was to be completed
by <i>His</i> grace and authority, but by human co-operation.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>So exact is the resemblance that we may put the two promises
in parallel columns to illustrate each other:</p>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="promises">
<tr><td align="left">Thou art Peter, and upon</td><td align="left" colspan="2">But I have prayed for</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left">this Rock I will build My</td><td align="left" colspan="2">thee that thy faith fail not;</td></tr>

<tr><td align="left">shall not prevail against it.</td><td align="left" colspan="2">confirm thy brethren.</td></tr>
</table></div>


<p>But light is thrown on the greatness of this pre-eminence
thus bestowed on Peter of confirming his brethren, if we
consider that the term is applied to the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, as bestowing by inherent power what
is here granted by participation. Of the Father it is said,
"To Him that is able to <i>establish</i> you according to my
Gospel&mdash;the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, be honour
and glory." And again, "Now He that <i>confirmeth us</i> with
you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God;" and
again, "The God of all grace, who hath called us unto His
eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a
little, will Himself perfect you, <i>confirm</i>, establish you."<a name="FNanchor_31_108" id="FNanchor_31_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_108" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Of Christ likewise: "As therefore you have received Jesus
Christ the Lord, walk ye in Him, rooted and built up
in Him, and <i>confirmed</i> in the faith." And "waiting
for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who
also will <i>confirm</i> you unto the end without crime." And
again: "Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself exhort
your hearts, and <i>confirm</i> you in every good word and
work."<a name="FNanchor_32_109" id="FNanchor_32_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_109" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And the Holy Spirit is continually mentioned
as the author of this gift, when, for instance, to Him
is ascribed "the teaching all truth," "the leading into
all truth," "the bringing to mind" all things which Christ
had said. And S. Paul prays "that He would grant you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>according to the riches of His glory, to be <i>strengthened</i> by
His Spirit with might unto the inward man."<a name="FNanchor_33_110" id="FNanchor_33_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_110" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>What, therefore, is proper to the most Holy Trinity, and
given in the highest sense by the Father, the Son, and the
Holy Ghost, it was the will of Christ should be shared by
Peter, according as man is capable of it. That is, it was
His pleasure that the same man, whom He had intimately
associated with Himself by communicating to him His prerogative
to be the Rock, should be closely joined with the
Blessed Trinity by participating in that privilege, whereby,
together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, He is the
confirmation and stability of the faithful. But if any rule
there can be whereby to measure pre-eminence and dignity,
it is surely that which is derived from participation of divine
properties and offices. And the closer that by these Peter
is shown to have approached to God, the higher his exaltation
above the rest of his brethren, who, as it has been
observed, are the Apostles. To them he is the Rock, and
them he is to confirm. Thus Theophylact, in the eleventh
century, commenting on this text, says: "The plain meaning
of this is, that, since I hold thee as the ruler of My disciples,
after thou shalt have wept over thy denial and
repented, confirm the rest. For this belongs to thee as
being after Me the rock and support" (literally, confirmation)
"of the Church. Now one may see that this is said
not only of the apostles, that they are confirmed by Peter,
but also concerning all the faithful until the consummation
of the world."</p>

<p>But looking more closely into the nature of this dignity,
since Christ, by the bestowal of heavenly gifts, caused Peter
to be conspicuous through the firmness of his own faith, and
through the charge of confirming the faith of his brethren,
we can call it by no fitter name than a Primacy of faith.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>For it has these two qualities: it cannot fail itself; and it
confirms others. And for the authority which it carries,
such a Primacy of faith cannot even be imagined without at
the same time imagining the office by which Peter was
bound to watch over the firmness and integrity of the common
faith. In this office two things are involved; first, the
right to, and therefore the possession of, all things necessary
for its fulfilment; and secondly, the duty by which all were
bound to agree in the profession of one faith with Peter.
So that Peter's dignity, rightly termed the Primacy of
faith, mainly consists in the supreme right of demanding
from all an agreement in faith with him.</p>

<p>It<a name="FNanchor_34_111" id="FNanchor_34_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_111" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> remains to explain the proper force of the word <i>confirm</i>.
Now this is a term of architecture, and as such is
joined with other terms relating to that art, as by S. Peter,
"the God of all grace&mdash;Himself fit you together" (as living
spiritual stones,) "confirm, strengthen, ground you."<a name="FNanchor_35_112" id="FNanchor_35_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_112" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It
means, to make anything fit so firmly that it cannot be
shaken. Thus in Holy Writ it frequently bears metaphorically
a moral signification, such as encouraging, supporting,
as we say, confirming the resolution, as in the passage just
quoted; and again, "Be watchful, and <i>confirm</i> the things
that remain, which are ready to die."<a name="FNanchor_36_113" id="FNanchor_36_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_113" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Now it cannot be
doubted that the phrase "confirm thy brethren," carries a
moral sense very like that in which the word <i>confirm</i>, when
applied to the spiritual building of the Church, is used of
God and of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_37_114" id="FNanchor_37_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_114" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> from whom the Church has both its
being and its perseverance to the end, and again of the
Apostles, who strengthen the flock entrusted to them by
the imparting spiritual gifts, as S. Paul says, "I long to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>you that I may impart unto you some spiritual grace to
strengthen you;"<a name="FNanchor_38_115" id="FNanchor_38_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_115" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> or, again, of Bishops, who, as sent by
the Apostles, and charged by the Holy Spirit with the
government of the Church, are bid to be watchful, and see
that those who stand do not fall, and those who are in danger
do not perish.<a name="FNanchor_39_116" id="FNanchor_39_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_116" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Accordingly, when it is said to Peter,
"And thou in thy turn one day confirm thy brethren," <i>the
charge and office are laid upon him, as an architect
divinely chosen, of holding together, strengthening, and
keeping in their place, the several parts of the ecclesiastical
structure</i>.</p>

<p>But what are these <i>parts</i> to be confirmed, and what is
the <i>nature</i> of the confirmation?</p>

<p>As to the first question there can be no controversy, it
being determined by the words, "confirm <i>thy brethren</i>:"
and it is plain from what is said above, that, by brethren,
are meant the Apostles. He had, therefore, the Apostles
committed to his charge <i>immediately</i>: but likewise, the
rest of all the faithful, <i>mediately</i>. When a person has
been named by Christ to confirm the Apostles expressly,
the nature of the case does not allow that the whole congregation
of believers be not in their persons committed to
him. The care of the flock is manifestly involved in the
care of the shepherds: and no one in his senses can doubt
that the man who is charged to support the pillars, is
charged to keep in their place the inferior stones.</p>

<p>And as to the <i>nature</i> of the confirmation, it is for protection
against the fraud of the great enemy. And the
danger lay in losing the faith. Peter, then, is charged to
confirm, in such sense that neither the pillars of the Church,
nor its inferior parts, may, by the loss of faith, be moved
from their place, and so severed from the Church's structure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>No charge can be higher than such an office of confirmation;
nor for any thing need we to be more thankful
to our Saviour; but, particularly, nothing can more distinctly
shew the divinely-appointed relation between Peter
on the one hand, and on the other, the rest of the Apostles,
and the whole company of the faithful; nothing define
more clearly the special authority of Peter; that is, to
protect and strengthen the unity of the faith, and to possess
all powers needed for such protection.</p>

<p>This charge was given after that by the prayer of Christ
the privilege had been gained for Peter's faith, <i>that it
should never fail</i>. Hence, that faith is become, in virtue
of such prayer, the infallible standard of evangelical
truth: as S. Cyprian expressed it of old, "that faith of
the Romans, which perfidy <i>cannot</i> approach."<a name="FNanchor_40_117" id="FNanchor_40_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_117" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> It follows
that all the faithful owe to it obedience. And Peter's
authority rests on a double title, <i>external</i> of mission,
<i>internal</i> of spiritual gift: the former contained in the
words of Christ the legislator, "And thou,<a name="FNanchor_41_118" id="FNanchor_41_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_118" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> in thy turn,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>one day confirm thy brethren:" the latter, in the words
of Christ, the bestower of all gifts, "But I have prayed
for thee, that thy faith fail not."</p>

<p>More than a thousand years ago two Easterns seem to
have expressed all this, one the Bishop Stephen, suppliantly
approaching Pope Martin I., in the Lateran Synod of
<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 649, and speaking of "the blessed Peter, in a manner
special and peculiar to himself, having above all a firm and
immutable faith in our Lord God, to consider with compassion,
and confirm his spiritual partners and brethren when
tossed by doubt: inasmuch as he has received power and
sacerdotal authority, according to the dispensation, over all,
from the very God for our sakes incarnate."<a name="FNanchor_42_119" id="FNanchor_42_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_119" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> And Theodore,
Abbot of the Studium, at Constantinople, addressing
Pope Paschal I., <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 817, in the midst of persecution
from the state, as if he were Peter himself: "Hear, O
Apostolic Head, O shepherd of the sheep of Christ, set
over them by God, O door-keeper of the kingdom of
heaven, O rock of the faith, upon which the Catholic
Church is built. For Peter art thou, who adornest
and governest the See of Peter. To thee, said Christ
our God, 'and thou, in thy turn, one day confirm thy
brethren.' Behold the time, behold the place, help us,
thou who art ordained by God for this. Stretch forth thy
hand as far as may be: power thou hast from God, because
thou art the chief of all."<a name="FNanchor_43_120" id="FNanchor_43_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_120" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Now let us<a name="FNanchor_44_121" id="FNanchor_44_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_121" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> view in its connexion the whole scope of our
Lord's discourse. We shall see how naturally the contest
of the Apostles arose out of what He had told them, and
how well the former and the latter part of His answer harmonize
together, and terminate that contest. We learn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>from S. John's record of this divine conversation, that our
Lord besought His Father, saying: "While I was with
them in the world, I kept them in Thy name&mdash;but now I
come to Thee:" that is, so long as I was with them visibly
in the world, (for invisibly I will always be with them, and
nurture them with the spiritual influx of the Vine,) I kept
them united in Thy name: "but now I come to Thee," I
leave the world, I relinquish the office of visible head. It
remains, that by the appointment of another visible head,
Thou shouldst entrust him with My office, provide for the
conspicuous unity of all, and preserve them joined to each
other and to Us. So S. Luke tells us, that no sooner had
our Lord declared to the Apostles, "the Son of man indeed
goeth according to that which is determined," than they
began to have a strife among them, "which of them should
seem to be the greater." For they had heard that Christ
would withdraw His visible presence, and they had heard
Him also earnestly entreating of the Father to provide for
their visible unity. Accordingly, the time seemed at hand
when another was to take this office of visible head; hence
their questioning, who should be the greater among them.
Now our Lord does not reprove this inference of theirs, but
He does reprove the temper in which they were coveting
pre-eminence. For, engaged as they were in this strife,
He warned them that the person who should be "the
Greater and the Ruler" among them, must follow in the
discharge of his office the rule and the standard which <i>He</i>
had set up in His own conduct, and not that which the
kings of the Gentiles follow. Thus, setting these in sharp
contrast, He proceeds. "The kings, indeed, of the nations,
lord it over their subjects, and love high titles, and to be
called benefactors: but I, though Lord and Master amongst
you, have dealt otherwise, as you know. For I have exercised,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
not a lordship, but a servitude: I have not sat at
table, but waited: I have not cared for titles, but called you
friends and brethren. Let this example then be before you
all, but specially before him who is to be the greater and
the ruler among you. For I appoint unto you, and dispose
of you, as My Father hath disposed of Me; of Me He hath
disposed that through humiliation, emptying of Myself,
ignominy, and manifold temptations, I should gain the
kingdom, reach the joys of heaven, and obtain all power
in heaven and on earth. So likewise dispose I of you, that,
through humility, sufferings, reproaches, hunger, thirst,
and all manner of temptations, you may reach whither I
have come, being worthy, after your hunger and your
thirst, to eat and drink at My table in My kingdom; after
being despised and dishonoured, to sit on thrones, judging
the twelve tribes of Israel. Now, hitherto you have trodden
with Me this royal way full of sorrows, and have continued
with Me in My temptations. But little will it profit
to begin, if you persevere not to the end. None shall be
crowned, save he who has contended lawfully; none be
saved, but he who perseveres to the end. Will you remain
with Me still in your temptations to come, and when I am
no longer present with you visibly, to protect and exhort,
will you preserve your steadfastness? Simon, Simon,
behold! I see Satan exerting all his force to overcome
your purpose, and to destroy the fidelity which you have
hitherto shewn Me. I see the danger to your faith and
your salvation approaching. But I, who, when visibly
present with you, left nothing undone to guard, protect,
and strengthen you visibly, so, too, when separated from
your bodily sight, will yet not leave you without a visible
support. Wherefore, Peter, I have prayed for thee, that
thou fail not, and thou, in thy turn, one day confirm thy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
brethren. Remember that thou hast to discharge that
part visibly towards thy brethren, which I, while yet mortal,
and visible, discharged: remember, that I therefore
had special care of thee, because it was My will, that thou,
confirmed by My prayers, shouldst confirm thy brethren,
My disciples, and My friends."<a name="FNanchor_45_122" id="FNanchor_45_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_122" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>Now from<a name="FNanchor_46_123" id="FNanchor_46_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_123" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> what has been said, it appears that Peter in
Holy Scripture is set forth as the source and principle of
ecclesiastical unity under a double but cognate image, as
Foundation, and as Confirmer. Of the former we will here
say nothing further, but a few consequences of the latter it
is desirable here to group together. I. The unity, then,
which consists in the profession of one and the same faith,
is conspicuous among those<a name="FNanchor_47_124" id="FNanchor_47_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_124" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> modes of unity by which
Christ has willed that His Church should be distinguished.
Now, first, S. Paul declares that the whole ministerial
hierarchy, from the Apostolate downwards, was instituted
by our Lord, for the sake of obtaining and preserving this
unity. "He gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and
other some Evangelists, and other some pastors and doctors,
for the perfecting" (literally, the fitting in together,
the same word which S. Peter had used in his prayer, ch.
v. 10,) "of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the
edifying of the body of Christ; until we all meet into the
unity of faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the
fulness of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_48_125" id="FNanchor_48_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_125" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> To this living hierarchy he expressly
attributes preservation from doctrinal error, proceeding
thus: "That henceforth we be no more children tossed to
and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine by
the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness by which they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>lie in wait to deceive." And, secondly, this hierarchy itself
was knitted and gathered up into a monarchy, and its
whole force and solidity made to depend on association with
Peter, to whom <i>alone</i> was said, "But I have prayed for
thee, that thy faith fail not;" to whom alone was enjoined,
"And thou, in thy turn, one day confirm thy brethren."</p>

<p>II. Accordingly the pre-eminence of Peter is well expressed
by the words,<a name="FNanchor_49_126" id="FNanchor_49_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_126" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> "Primacy of faith," "chiefship of
faith," "chiefship in the episcopate of faith," meaning
thereby a peculiar authority to prescribe the faith, and
determine its profession, and so protect its unity and purity.
This is conveyed in the words of Christ, confirm thy
brethren. Thus<a name="FNanchor_50_127" id="FNanchor_50_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_127" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> S. Bernard addressed Innocent II.,
"All emergent dangers and scandals in the kingdom of
God, specially those which concern the faith, are to be
referred to your Apostolate. For I conceive that we should
look especially for reparation of the faith to the spot where
faith <i>cannot</i><a name="FNanchor_51_128" id="FNanchor_51_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_128" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> fail. That indeed is the prerogative of this
see. For to whom else was it once said, 'I have prayed
for thee, Peter, that thy faith fail not?' Therefore what
follows is required of Peter's successor: 'And thou in thy
turn one day confirm thy brethren.' And this is now
necessary. It is time for you, most loving father, to recognise
your chiefship, to approve your zeal, and so make
your ministry honoured. In that you clearly fulfil the
part of Peter, whose seat you occupy, if by your admonition
you confirm hearts fluctuating in faith, if by your
authority you crush those who corrupt it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p><p>III. All who have received the ministry of the word, and
the charge of defending the faith and preserving unity, and
are "ambassadors in Christ's name," have a claim to be
listened to, but he above all who holds the chiefship
of faith, and who received the charge, "Confirm thy
brethren." He therefore must be the supreme standard of
faith, which is just what S. Peter Chrysologus, in the fifth
century, wrote to Eutyches: "We exhort you in all things,
honourable brother, to pay obedience to what is written by
the most blessed Pope of the Roman city; for S. Peter,
who both lives and rules in his own see, grants to those
who ask for it the truth of faith."<a name="FNanchor_52_129" id="FNanchor_52_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_129" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>IV. And in this prerogative of Peter, to be heard above
all others, we find the meaning of certain ancient expressions.
Thus<a name="FNanchor_53_130" id="FNanchor_53_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_130" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>Prudentius calls him, "the first disciple of
God;"<a name="FNanchor_54_131" id="FNanchor_54_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_131" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>S. Augustine, "the figure of the Church;"<a name="FNanchor_55_132" id="FNanchor_55_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_132" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>S.
Chrysostome, "the mouthpiece of the disciples, and teacher
of the world;"<a name="FNanchor_56_133" id="FNanchor_56_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_133" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>S. Ephrem Syrus, "the candle, the
tongue of the disciples, and the voice of preachers;"<a name="FNanchor_57_134" id="FNanchor_57_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_134" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>S.
Cyril of Jerusalem, "the prince of the Apostles, and the
highest preacher of the truth." In these and such like
continually recurring expressions we recognise his chiefship
in the episcopate of faith, his being the standard of faith,
and his representing the Catholic faith, as the branches
are gathered up in the root, and the streamlets in the
fountain.</p>

<p>V. Our <a name="FNanchor_58_135" id="FNanchor_58_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_135" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>Lord has most solemnly declared, and S. Paul
repeated, that no one shall be saved without maintaining
the true and uncorrupt faith. Of this Peter's faith is the
standard and exemplar. Accordingly by the law of Christ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>unity with the faith of Peter is necessary to salvation.
This law our Lord set forth in the words, "Confirm thy
brethren." And to this the Fathers in their expressions
above quoted allude.</p>

<p>VI. The true faith and the true Church are so indivisibly
united, that they cannot even be conceived apart from
each other, faith being to the Church as light to the
sun. But the true faith neither is, nor can be, other than
that which Peter, "the first disciple of God," "the teacher
of the world," "the mouthpiece of the disciples," and "the
confirmer of his brethren," holds and proposes to others.
No communion, therefore, called after Christ, which yet
differs from that faith, can claim either the name or dignity
of the true Church.</p>

<p>VII. If any knowledge have a special value, it is surely
that by which we have a safe and ready test of the true
faith and the true Church. It is of the utmost necessity
to know and embrace both, and the means of reaching
them are proportionably valuable. Now that test abides in
Peter, by keeping which before us we can neither miss the
true faith nor the true Church. For no other true faith
can there be than that which he delivers, who received the
charge of confirming his brethren, nor other true Church
than what Christ built, and is building still. Hence the
expression of S. Ambrose,<a name="FNanchor_59_136" id="FNanchor_59_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_136" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> "where Peter is, there is the
Church;" and of Stephen<a name="FNanchor_60_137" id="FNanchor_60_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_137" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> of Larissa, to Pope Boniface II.
(<span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 530.) "that all the churches of the world rest in the
confession of Peter."</p>

<p>VIII. With all these agrees that famous and most early
testimony of S. Cyprian,<a name="FNanchor_61_138" id="FNanchor_61_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_138" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> that men "fall away from
the Church into heresy and schism so long as there is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>no regard <i>to the source of truth, no looking to the head</i>,
nor keeping to the doctrine of our heavenly Master. If
any one consider and weigh this, he will not need length of
comment or argument. It is easy to offer proofs to a faithful
mind, because in that case the truth may be quickly
stated." And then he quotes our Lord's words to Peter,
Matt. xvi. 16, and John xxi. 17, adding, "upon him being
one He builds His Church." Therefore that Church can
neither be torn from the one on whom she is built, nor profess
any other faith, save what that one, who is Peter,
proposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_118" id="Footnote_41_118"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_118"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> As far as the <i>words</i> by themselves go, it is the opinion of the best commentators that
they may be equally well rendered, "And thou, when thou art converted," or, "And thou,
in thy turn, one day," &amp;c. But as it is impossible to bring a discussion turning on a Hebrew
idiom conveyed in a Greek word before the English reader, we must here restrict ourselves
to the proof arising from the <i>sense</i> and <i>context</i>. And here one thing alone, among several
which may be urged, is sufficient to prove that the sense preferred in the text, "And thou in
thy turn one day confirm thy brethren," is the true one. For the other rendering supposes
that the time of Peter's conversion would also be the time of his confirming his brethren;
whereas this was far otherwise. He was converted by our Lord looking on him that same
night shortly after his denial, and "immediately went out and wept bitterly." But he did not
succeed to the charge of confirming his brethren till after our Lord's ascension. It must be
added that the collocation of the original words [Greek: kai su pote epistrepsas stêrixon] is such as
absolutely to require that the joint action indicated by them should belong to the same
time, and that an <i>indefinite</i> time expressed by [Greek: pote]. Now this would be false according to
the rendering, "And thou, when thou art converted, confirm thy brethren," for the conversion
was immediate and definite, the confirmation distant and indefinite; whereas it
exactly agrees with the rendering, "And thou in thy turn one day confirm thy brethren."
</p><p>
Those who wish to see the whole controversy admirably drawn out may find it in Passaglia,
b. 2, ch. 13.</p></div>

<h3>THE INVESTITURE OF PETER.</h3>


<p>Our Lord has hitherto, while on earth,<a name="FNanchor_1_139" id="FNanchor_1_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_139" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> ruled as its
visible head that body of disciples which He had chosen out
of the world, and which His Father had given Him. And
this body He for the first time called the Church in that
famous prophecy<a name="FNanchor_2_140" id="FNanchor_2_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_140" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> wherein He named the person, who, by
virtue of an intimate association with Himself, the Rock,
should be its foundation, and the duration of which until
the consummation of the world, He pronounced at the same
time, in spite of all the rage of "spiritual wickedness in
high places" against it, because it should be founded upon
the rock which He should lay.</p>

<p>Secondly, He had, at that period of His ministry when
He thought it meet, the second year, selected out of the
rest of His disciples, after ascending into a mountain and
continuing the night long in prayer, twelve whom He
named Apostles&mdash;as before and above all sent by Him&mdash;for
"He called whom He would Himself, and they came to
Him," to whom "He gave authority over unclean spirits,
to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every weakness,"
whom He chose also "to be with Him," His personal
attendants, "and to send them to preach;" to whom, moreover,
He subsequently made a promise that whatever they
should bind on earth, should be bound in heaven, and
whatever they should loose on earth should be loosed in
heaven.<a name="FNanchor_3_141" id="FNanchor_3_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_141" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, as at a certain time in His ministry, that is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>second year, He had selected twelve to be nearer His person
than the rest of His disciples, so at a yet later time, the
third year of His ministry, He had set apart one out of the
twelve, to whom from the very first, and before either he,
or any one, had been called to be an Apostle, or even, as it
would seem, a disciple, He had given a prophetic name;
whom by word and deed, in correspondence with that name,
He designated to be the future Rock of His Church, to be
the Bearer of the keys, which opened or shut the entrance
to His mystical Holy City, to be endued with power <i>singly</i>
to bind and to loose; and whom at last, on the very eve of
His being taken away from His disciples, He pointed out
as the future "First one," "Greater one," or "Ruler," among
them, having, as such, had given to him a <i>special</i> and <i>singular</i>
charge, after the departure of the Head, to "confirm
his brethren."</p>

<p>It is manifest that this was all which, before His offering
Himself up for the sin of the world, and the withdrawal of
His visible presence thereupon ensuing, He could do for
the government of His Church. For as long as He was
there, the Son of Man among men, seen, felt, touched, and
handled, the sacred voice in their ears, and the divine eyes
gazing bodily upon them, He was not only the fountain of
all headship and rule, but He exercised in His own person
the highest functions of that headship and visible rule. He
daily encouraged, warned, corrected, taught, united them;
in short, to use His own words, "while He was with them,
He kept them in His Father's name."<a name="FNanchor_4_142" id="FNanchor_4_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_142" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>But now another time, and other dangers were approaching.
The sword was drawn which should "strike the shepherd,"
there was a fear that "the sheep would be scattered,"
not only for a moment, but for ever. To meet this the care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>of the divine guardian was necessary in a further disposition
of those powers which He received at His resurrection
from the dead. For henceforth His visits, as of a risen
King, were to be few and sudden, when He pleased, and at
times they expected not, "for forty days appearing to them
and speaking of the kingdom of God," and as soon as His
final injunctions had been thus royally given, "the heavens
were to receive Him till the time of the restoration of all
things." The Apostles could no longer "be with Him," as
before, nor He "keep them," as in the days of His flesh.</p>

<p>How, then, does He complete the ministerial hierarchy
which sprung from His own divine Person on earth, and
which is to rule His Church and represent that Person from
His first to His second coming?</p>

<p>Now, first, we must remark, that while great care is taken
to make known to all the Apostles the resurrection of the
Lord, yet a special solicitude is shown with regard to that
one who was to be "the Ruler." Thus the angels, announcing
the fact to the holy women at the sepulchre, "He
is risen, He is not here, behold the place where they laid
Him," add, "but go, tell His disciples <i>and Peter</i>, that He
goeth before you into Galilee."<a name="FNanchor_5_143" id="FNanchor_5_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_143" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The expression indicates
his superior place, as when Peter, himself delivered from
prison, recounted to the disciples at the house of Mark his
escape, and added, "Tell these things to James and to the
brethren," where no one fails to see the pre-eminence given
to James, by such a mention of him, that apostle being the
Bishop of Jerusalem, and so put over the brethren, and, with
himself, one of those who "seemed to be pillars." Again,
to Peter our Lord appeared first among the Apostles.
S. Paul exhibiting a sort of sum of Christian doctrine, as he
says "the Gospel which I preached unto you," begins, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>delivered unto you first of all that which I also received,
how that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures;
and that He was buried, and that He rose again the
third day, according to the Scriptures; and that He was
seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven." By him
alone, first, then by them in conjunction with him. And
further, St. Paul's words seem to express a sort of descending
ratio, "Then was He seen by more than five hundred
brethren at once, of whom many remain until this present,
and some are fallen asleep. After that He was seen by
James, then by all the Apostles. And last of all He was
seen also by me, as by one born out of due time. For I am
the least of the Apostles."<a name="FNanchor_6_144" id="FNanchor_6_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_144" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And while they were yet in
doubt, and for joy could not receive the marvellous tidings,
when brought by the women, as soon as our Lord appeared
to Peter, their hesitation was removed, and the two disciples
returning from Emmaus&mdash;themselves full of His wonderful
conversation with them&mdash;"found the eleven gathered
together and those that were with them, saying, The Lord
is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon," as the Church
in her exultation repeats, where philologists tell us that the
Greek <i>and</i> bears what is often the Hebrew meaning, and
signifies "for," as if no doubt could remain any longer of
their happiness, when Peter had become a witness of it.</p>

<p>These are indications of superiority, slight perhaps in
themselves, if they stood alone, but not slight as bearing
tacit witness to a fact otherwise resting on its own explicit
evidence. If one of the Apostles was destined to be the
head of the rest, this is what we should have expected to
happen to that one, and this did happen to Peter, who is
elsewhere made the head of the Apostles.</p>

<p>But now we come to those most important injunctions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>which our Lord gave to His Apostles after His resurrection,
concerning the government of His Church. And here it
becomes necessary to mark with the utmost accuracy what
He said and what He gave to all the Apostles in common,
and what to Peter in particular.</p>

<p>First of all, then, we may remark our Lord's care to
redeem the promises which He had made to the Twelve,
and to convey to them their legislative, judicial, and executive
powers. These are mentioned by each of the four
Evangelists, in somewhat different terms, but alike involving
the distinctive apostolic powers of immediate institution
by Christ, and universal mission; as Apostles they are <i>sent</i>,
and they are sent <i>by Christ</i>. The form recorded in S.
Matthew is, "All power is given unto Me in heaven and in
earth. Go ye, therefore, and make disciples all nations,
baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever I have commanded you; and behold I am with
you all days, even to the consummation of the world."</p>

<p>The form of S. Mark is, "Go ye into the whole world,
and preach the gospel to every creature."</p>

<p>S. Luke refers specially in two passages to the descent of
the Holy Ghost, as being Himself as well the Divine "Gift,"
and the immediate worker of all graces in man, as the
principle of the ecclesiastical hierarchy. "And I send the
promise of My Father upon you, but stay you in the city
till you be endued with power from on high." And again,
"Eating together with them, He commanded them that
they should not depart from Jerusalem, but should wait for
the promise of the Father, which you have heard," saith He,
"by My mouth; for John, indeed, baptized with water, but
you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days
hence." "You shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
coming upon you, and you shall be witnesses unto Me in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even to the
uttermost part of the earth."</p>

<p>The form recorded by S. John is, "As the Father hath
sent Me, I also send you. When He had said this, He
breathed on them; and He said to them, Receive ye the
Holy Ghost; whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven
them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are
retained."<a name="FNanchor_7_145" id="FNanchor_7_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_145" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Now, it may be remarked that these passages of the
several evangelists are <i>identical</i> in their force; that is, they
each convey all those powers which constitute the Apostolate.
These are received by all the Apostles in common, and together;
and in the joint possession of them consists that
<i>equality</i> which is often attributed by the ancient writers to
the Apostles, as notably by S. Cyprian, "He gives to all
the Apostles an equal power, and says, 'as the Father sent
Me, I also send you.'" And again, "Certainly the other
Apostles also were what Peter was, endued with an equal
fellowship, both of honour and power."<a name="FNanchor_8_146" id="FNanchor_8_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_146" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>And these Apostolic powers, legislative, judicial, and
executive, are afterwards referred to as exercised; as in
Acts ch. xv., where the first council passes decrees which
bind the Church, nay, which go forth in the joint name of
the Holy Ghost, and the rulers of the Church, "It hath
seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us;"&mdash;which are delivered
by S. Paul to the cities to be kept: Acts xvi. 4&mdash;as
in Acts xx. 28, where bishops are charged to rule the
Church, each over his flock, wherein the Holy Ghost has
placed him&mdash;as in 1 Cor. v. 1-5, where S. Paul, "in the
name of our Lord Jesus Christ," excommunicates&mdash;as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>2 Cor. x. 6, where he sets forth his apostolic power&mdash;as in
the Epistles to Titus and Timothy, where he sets them in
authority, enjoins them to ordain priests in every city, and
commands them to "reprove," or "rebuke."</p>

<p>And all these powers S. Peter, of course, as one of the
Twelve, had received in common with the rest. The limit
to them would seem to lie in their being shared in common
by twelve; as, for instance, universal mission dwelling in
such a body must practically be determined and limited
somehow to the different members of that body, or one
would interfere with the other. But there is nothing in
these powers which answers to the images of "the rock,"
on which the Church is built, the single "bearer of the
keys," and "confirmer" of his brethren, which Christ had
appropriated to one Apostle.</p>

<p>In like manner, then, as our Lord fulfilled His promises
to the Twelve, so did He those to S. Peter, and we
find written the committal of an authority to him exactly
answering to these images; an authority, which expresses
the full legislative, judicial and executive power of the head,
which can be executed by one alone at a time, and is of its
own nature supreme, and responsible to none save God.
It remained for our Lord to find an image setting forth all
this as decisively as that of the Rock, the Bearer of the
keys, and the Confirmer of his brethren.</p>

<p>Once, as He passed along the shores of the lake of
Galilee, He had seen two fishermen casting their net into
the sea, and had "said to them, Come after Me, and I will
make you fishers of men, and immediately leaving their nets,
they followed Him." Once again, too, He had gone into the
ship of that same fisherman, and sitting, taught the multitudes
out of it. And then He bade that fisherman, "who
had laboured all the night and taken nothing, to launch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
out into the deep," and in faith, "let down his nets for a
draught," whereupon "he enclosed so great a multitude of
fishes that the net brake."<a name="FNanchor_9_147" id="FNanchor_9_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_147" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> And, again, in after times,
when the fisherman had become an Apostle, that same ship
waited on His convenience, and carried Him across the
lake. It was there He was asleep when the storm raged,
and His disciples in little faith awoke Him, saying, "Master,
save us, we perish," not yet knowing that the ship which
carried the Lord might be tost, but could not sink.<a name="FNanchor_10_148" id="FNanchor_10_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_148" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
From it they beheld Him walking on the sea, in the fourth
watch of the night, when Peter, in his fervour, desired to
join Him, and going to meet his Lord on the waves, his
faith failed him, and he began to sink, till the Almighty
hand supported him, and drew him with it to the ship,
which "presently was at the land to which they were
going."<a name="FNanchor_11_149" id="FNanchor_11_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_149" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And now, Peter, and Thomas, and Nathaniel,
and the sons of Zebedy, and two others, were once more on
that same ship and sea, but no longer with Him who had
commanded the winds, and walked on the waves. Once
more, too, they<a name="FNanchor_12_150" id="FNanchor_12_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_150" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> toiled all the night, but "caught nothing:"
when, lo, in the morning light, Jesus stood on the
shore, but yet unknown to them, and bade them cast the
net on the right side of the ship, "and now they were not
able to draw it for the multitude of fishes." Thus He
revealed Himself to them, and invited them to eat with
Him of the fishes which they had caught. "Then Simon
Peter went up, and drew the net to land, full of great
fishes, one hundred fifty-three. And although there were
so many, the net was not broken:" for, indeed, that
draught of great fishes, gathered by Peter at Christ's command,
betokened God's elect, whom the Church is to gather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>out of the sea of this world, who cannot break from the net,
which net, therefore, Peter drew to land, even the everlasting
shore whereon Christ welcomes His own. And after
that marvellous banquet of the disciples with their Lord,
betokening the never ending marriage feast, wherein "the
roasted fish is Christ in His passion,"<a name="FNanchor_13_151" id="FNanchor_13_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_151" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> our Lord proceeds
to crown all that series of distinctions, wherewith, since
imposing the prophetic name, He had marked out Simon,
the son of Jonas, to be the Leader of His disciples; and
thus He fulfils by the side of the lake of Galilee what He
foreshadowed when He first looked upon Peter, what He
promised in the quarters of Cesarea Philippi, and what He
repeated on the eve of His passion.</p>

<p>It was His will to appoint one to take His place on
earth. Now He had assumed to Himself specially a particular
title, under which of old time His prophets had
foretold His advent among men, and which above all others
expressed His tender love for fallen man. It had been
said of Him, "I will set up one shepherd over them, and
He shall feed them, even my servant David: He shall feed
them, and He shall be their shepherd." And again: "Say
to the cities of Judah, behold your God.&mdash;He shall feed
His flock like a shepherd: He shall gather together the
lambs with His arm, and shall take them up in His bosom,
and He Himself shall carry them that are with young."
And, once more, in the very prophecy by which the chief
priests and scribes declared to Herod that He must be born
at Bethlehem, "For from thee shall go forth the ruler,
who shall feed (or shepherd) My people Israel." Appropriating
these predictions to Himself, the Lord had said:
"I am the good shepherd.<a name="FNanchor_14_152" id="FNanchor_14_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_152" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The good shepherd giveth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>His life for His sheep. And other sheep I have which are
not of this fold; them also I must bring; and there shall
be one fold and one shepherd." And now it was His
pleasure to give this particular title, so specially His own,
to Peter, and to Peter alone, and to Peter in most marked
contrast even with the best beloved of His other disciples,
and to Peter, thrice repeating the charge, and varying the
expression of it so as to include the term in its utmost
force. "When, therefore, they had dined, Jesus said to
Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me more
than these? He saith to Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest
that I love Thee. He saith to him, Feed My lambs. He
saith to him again, Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me?
He saith to Him, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love
Thee. He saith to him, Feed My lambs. He saith to him
the third time, Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me? Peter
was grieved because He had said to him the third time,
lovest thou Me? And he said to Him, Lord, Thou knowest
all things: Thou knowest that I love Thee. He said to
him, Feed My sheep."</p>

<p>Our Lord had before addressed the seven disciples present
in common, "Children, have you any meat?" "Cast
the net, and you shall find." "Bring hither of the fishes
which you have now caught." "Come and dine." But
now, turning to one in particular, He singles him out in the
most special manner, by his name, by asking of him a love
greater than that of any others towards Himself, by conferring
on him a charge, which, as we shall see, from its
extension excludes its being held in joint possession by any
other, and by a prophecy concerning the manner of his
death, which is wholly particular to Peter. If it is possible
by any words to convey a power and a charge to a particular
person, and to exclude the rest of the company from
that special power and charge, it is done here.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>But, secondly, it is a charge of a very high and distinguishing
nature indeed, for our Lord before conferring it
demands of Peter, as a condition, greater love towards His
own person than that felt for Him by any of the Twelve&mdash;even
by the sons of Zebedy, whom from their zeal He surnamed
Boanerges, sons of thunder&mdash;even by the disciple
whom He loved, and who lay on His breast at the last
supper. What must that charge be, the preliminary condition
for which is a greater love for Jesus than that of the
beloved disciple? What shall be a fitting sequel to
"Simon, son of John, lovest thou me <i>more</i> than these?"
What, again, the importance of that office, in bestowing
which our Lord thrice repeats the condition, and thrice inculcates
the charge? The words of God are not spoken at
random, nor His repetitions without effect. What, again,
are the <i>subjects</i> of the charge? They are "My lambs,"
and "My sheep," that is, the fold itself of the Great Shepherd.
As He said, "If I wash thee not, thou shalt have
no part with Me," so those who are not either His lambs or
His sheep, form no part of His fold. Others, too, in Holy
Writ, are addressed as shepherds, but with a limitation, as,
"Take heed to the whole flock <i>wherein</i> the Holy Ghost
hath placed you bishops," or "feed the flock of God <i>which
is among you</i>." And, more largely far it was said, "Go
ye, therefore, and make disciples all nations;" and "Go ye
into the whole world and preach the Gospel to every creature."<a name="FNanchor_15_153" id="FNanchor_15_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_153" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
But they to whom this was said were yet themselves
sheep of the Great Shepherd, and in committing the
world to them, He did not commit <i>them</i> to each other.
Whereas here, they too, as His sheep, are committed to
one, even Peter; and very expressly, in the persons of
James and John, and the rest present, "lovest thou Me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>more than these?" A particular flock is never termed absolutely
and simply "the flock," or "the flock of God," but
"the flock <i>which is among you</i>," "<i>in which the Holy Ghost
hath made you bishops</i>." And, again, the Apostles are
sent in common to the whole world, to preach to all nations,
and to form one flock; but they are twelve, and "power
given to several carries its restriction in its division, whilst
power given to one alone and over all, and without exception,
carries with it plenitude, and, not having to be divided
with any other, it has no bounds save those which its terms
convey."<a name="FNanchor_16_154" id="FNanchor_16_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_154" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> What are the terms here? "Feed," and "be
shepherd over" or "rule" "My lambs and My sheep." The
terms have no limit, save that of salvation itself. Such,
then, are the <i>persons</i> indicated as subjects of this charge.
But what is the nature of the charge? Two different words
of unequal extent and force in the original, but both
rendered "feed" in the translation, convey this. One
means "to give food" simply, the other, of far higher
and nobler reach, embraces every act of care and providence
in the government of others, under an image the
farthest removed from the spirit of pride and ambition.
Such is even its heathen meaning, and the first of poets
termed Agamemnon by this word, "Shepherd of the people."
By this word, S. Paul, and S. Peter<a name="FNanchor_17_155" id="FNanchor_17_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_155" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> himself, express
the power of the bishop over his own flock. And so our Lord,
here instituting the Bishop of Bishops, the one Shepherd
of the one fold, gives to Peter over all his flock, the very
word given to <i>Him</i> in the famous prophecy, "Thou, Bethlehem,
the land of Juda, art not the least among the
princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come forth the
captain that shall <i>rule</i> My people Israel:" the very word,
which used of Himself in Psalm ii. to express all His power
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>and dominion, in His revelation to S. John, is spoken of His
own triumphant career, as the Word of God going forth to
battle, "He shall <i>rule</i> them with a rod of iron;" and,
again, in the same book is applied by Himself to set forth
the honour which He will give "to him that shall overcome
and keep My works unto the end."<a name="FNanchor_18_156" id="FNanchor_18_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_156" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Thus, just as in the
<i>persons</i> pointed out, the <i>subject</i> of this charge is <i>universal</i>,
so in the <i>terms</i> by which it is expressed, the <i>nature</i> of the
power is <i>supreme</i>. What the bishop is to his own flock,
Peter is made to "the flock of God:" and this at once, in
the most simple, as well as in the most absolute and
emphatic manner, by institution from the chief Shepherd
Himself, at the close of His ministry, and by associating
Peter singly with Himself in His most distinctive title. If
the fold of Christ is equivalent to "the Church of Christ,"
and "the kingdom of heaven," so to feed and to rule the
lambs and the sheep of that fold is equivalent to being "the
Rock" of that Church, and "the Bearer of the keys," as
well as <i>the First, the Greater one, and the Ruler</i> in that
kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>Again, looking at the circumstances under which this
charge is received by Peter, it either conveys that special
and singular honour and power which we have here set
forth, or <i>none at all</i>. For Peter had <i>already</i> received the
full Apostolic authority: he had heard together with the
rest of the Apostles those words of power, "As My Father
sent Me, I also send you," and the charge following, to
bind and to loose. It could not therefore be this power
which was given him, for he had it already. All
which James and John, the sons of thunder, ever had
given them, he also had before these words were uttered.
Besides a power which was to be shared by James and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>John, and the rest of the Apostles, could not be given in
terms which distinguished him from them, "lovest thou Me
<i>more than these</i>?" It could not be the mere forgiveness of
his denial, for not only did the Apostolate, since conferred,
carry that, but when our Lord appeared to him first of
all the Apostles after His resurrection, it was a token of
such forgiveness. There remained nothing else to give
him, but presidency over the Apostles themselves, the
reward of superior love, as was prophesied and promised to
him in reward for superior faith. For these two oracles of
our Lord exactly correspond to each other as promise and
performance. Their conditions and their terms shed a
reciprocal light on each other. In the one there is the
great confession, "Thou art the Christ the Son of the
living God;" in the other as singular a declaration,
"Lovest thou Me more than these? Yea, Lord." In the
one there follows the reward, "And I say to thee, that
thou art Peter," &amp;c.: and in the other a like reward, "Feed
My lambs, be shepherd over My sheep." The one is future,
"I will build, I will give, thou shalt bind, thou shall loose:"
the other present, "Feed and be shepherd." What concerns
"the Church and the kingdom of heaven" in the one,
concerns "the fold" in the other. And the promise and
performance are singularly restricted to Peter&mdash;"I say
unto thee, Thou art Peter"&mdash;"Simon, son of John, lovest
thou Me more than these?"</p>

<p>As then Peter received the promise of the supreme
episcopate <i>before all</i> and <i>by himself</i>, under the terms that
he should be the Rock, by being built on which the Church
should never fall, that he should be the Bearer of the keys
in the kingdom of heaven, and that <i>singly</i> he should bind
and loose in heaven and in earth; so <i>after</i> his own Apostolate,
and that of the rest had been completed, <i>by himself</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and as the crown of the divine work, he received the fulfilment
of that supreme episcopate, under the terms, "Feed
My lambs, be shepherd over My sheep." And as a part
out of that magnificent promise made to him <i>singly</i>, was
afterwards taken and made to the Apostles <i>jointly</i> with him,
for so "it was the design of Jesus Christ to put first in one
alone what afterwards He meant to put in several; but the
sequel does not reverse the beginning, nor the first lose his
place. That first word, 'Whatsoever thou shalt bind,' said
to one alone, has already ranged under his power each one
of those to whom shall be said, 'Whatsoever ye shall remit;'
for the promises of Jesus Christ, as well as His gifts, are
without repentance; and what is once given indefinitely
and universally is irrevocable:"<a name="FNanchor_19_157" id="FNanchor_19_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_157" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> so when Peter and the
rest already possessed the whole Apostolate, the commission
to go and preach to the whole world, and to make
disciples of all nations, a power was added to Peter to
make up what was promised to him originally; the Apostles
themselves, with the whole fold, were put under his
charge; he represented the person of the Great Shepherd:
and the divine work was complete.</p>

<p>Thus the powers of the Apostolate and the Primacy are
not antagonistic, but fit into, and harmonise with each
other. In the college of the Twelve, as before inaugurated,
and sent forth into the whole world, something had been
wanting, save that, "by the appointment of a head, the
occasion of schism was taken away:"<a name="FNanchor_20_158" id="FNanchor_20_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_158" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and Satan would
have shaken the whole fabric, but that there was one
divinely set to "confirm the brethren." He who "kept
them" once, when "with them," by His personal presence,
now kept them for evermore by the word of His power,
issued on the shore of the lake of Galilee, but resounding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>through every age, clear and decisive, amid the fall of
empires, and the change of races, and heard by all His
flock to the utmost of the isles of the sea, till the day of the
Son of Man comes,&mdash;"Simon, son of John, lovest thou Me
more than these? Feed My lambs: Feed My sheep."</p>

<p>And that the universal and supreme authority over the
Church of Christ, was in these words committed to Peter
by the Lord, is the belief of antiquity. Thus, S. Ambrose,
in the west: "It is not doubtful that Peter believed, and
believed because he loved, and loved because he believed.
Whence, too, he is grieved at being asked a third time,
Lovest thou Me? For we ask those of whom we doubt.
But the Lord does not doubt, but asks not to learn, but to
teach him whom, on the point of ascending into heaven, He
was leaving, <i>as it were, the successor and representative of
His love</i>.<a name="FNanchor_21_159" id="FNanchor_21_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_159" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It is because he alone out of all makes a profession,
that <i>he is preferred to all</i>. Lastly, for the third
time, the Lord asks him, no longer, <i>hast</i> thou <i>a regard</i>
(diligis me) for Me, but <i>lovest</i> (amas) thou Me: and now he
is ordered to feed, not the lambs, as at first, who need a
milk diet, nor the little sheep, as secondly, but the more
perfect sheep, <i>in order that he who was the more perfect
might have the government</i>."<a name="FNanchor_22_160" id="FNanchor_22_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_160" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> In the East, S. Chrysostome,
"Why, then, passing by the rest, does He converse with him
on these things? <i>He was the chosen of the Apostles, and
the mouthpiece of the disciples, and the head of the band.</i>
Therefore, also Paul once went up to see him rather than
the rest. It was, besides, to shew him, that for the future
he must be bold, as his denial was done away with, that
<i>He puts into his hands the presidency over the brethren.</i>
And He does not mention the denial, nor reproach him with
what had past; but He says, if thou lovest Me, <i>rule the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>brethren</i>, and show now that warm affection which on
all occasions thou didst exhibit, and in which thou didst
exult, and the life which thou didst offer to lay down for
Me, now spend for My sheep." Again, "thrice He asks the
question, and thrice lays on him the same command, showing
at how high a price He sets <i>the charge of His own
sheep</i>." Again, "he was put in charge with the direction of
his brethren." "He made him great promises <i>and put the
world into his hands</i>." Thus John and James, and the rest
of the Apostles were committed to Peter, but never Peter
to them: and he adds, "But if any one asks, How then did
James receive the throne of Jerusalem? I would reply that
He elected Peter <i>not to be the teacher of this throne, but of
the whole world</i>." And in another place, "Why did He
shed His blood to purchase those sheep <i>which He committed
to Peter and his successors</i>? With reason then said
Christ, 'who is the faithful and prudent servant whom his
Lord hath set over His own<a name="FNanchor_23_161" id="FNanchor_23_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_161" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> house?'" Theophylact repeated,
seven hundred years later, the perpetual tradition of
the East. "He puts into Peter's hands the headship over
the sheep of the whole world, and to no other but to him
gives He this; first, because he was distinguished above all,
and the mouth-piece of the whole band; and secondly, showing
to him that he must be confident, as his denial was put
out of account." And if S. Leo, a Pope, declares that
"though there be among the people of God many priests
and many shepherds, yet Peter rules all by immediate commission,
whom Christ also rules by Sovereign power,"<a name="FNanchor_24_162" id="FNanchor_24_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_162" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the
great Eastern, Saint Basil, assigned an adequate reason for
this near a century before, when he viewed all pastoral
authority in the Church as included in this grant to Peter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>declaring that the spiritual "ruler is none else but one who
represents the person of the Saviour, and offers up to God
the salvation of those who obey him, and this we learn from
Christ Himself <i>in that He appointed Peter to be the shepherd
of His Church after</i><a name="FNanchor_25_163" id="FNanchor_25_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_163" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> <i>Himself</i>."</p>

<p>But especially must we quote S. Cyprian, because to that
equality of the Apostles as such, before referred to by us,
by considering which without regard to the proportion
of faith some have been led astray, he adds the full recognition
of the Primacy, and urges its extreme importance.
Thus quoting the promise and the fulfilment, "Thou art
Peter, &amp;c." and "Feed My sheep," he goes on, "Upon him
being one He builds His Church; and <i>though</i> He gives to
all the Apostles an equal power, and says, "As the Father
sent Me, I also send you, &amp;c.," yet in order to manifest
unity He has, by His own authority, so placed the source of
the same unity as to begin from one. Certainly the other
Apostles also were what Peter was, endued with an equal
fellowship both of honour and power, but a commencement
is made from unity, that the Church may be set before us
as one."<a name="FNanchor_26_164" id="FNanchor_26_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_164" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> That is, the Apostles were equal as to the
powers bestowed in John xx. 23-5, but as to those given in
Matt. xvi. 18-19, Luke xxii. 31-3, and John xxi. 15-18,
"the Church was built upon Peter alone," and he was made
the source and ever-living spring of ecclesiastical unity.</p>

<p>Yet clearly as our Lord in this charge associates Peter
with Himself, puts him over his brethren, the other Apostles,
and fulfils to him all that He ever promised, as to
making him "the first," "the greater one" and "the ruler
or leader," by that one title of "the Shepherd," in which
is summed up all authority over His Church, and the very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>purpose of His own divine mission, "to seek and to save
that which was lost," still a touch of tenderness is added by
the Master's hand, which brings out all this more forcibly,
and must have told personally on Peter's feelings and those
of his fellow-disciples, as the highest and most solemn consecration
to his singular office. For when the Lord spoke
that parable, "I am the good shepherd," He added, as the
token of the character, "the good shepherd giveth His life
for His sheep." And so now, appointing Peter to take
His place over the flock, He adds to him this token also:
"Amen, amen, I say to thee, when thou wast younger, thou
didst gird thyself, and didst walk where thou wouldst, but
when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands,
and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou
wouldst not." "When thou wast younger, thou didst gird
thyself," alluding, perhaps, to that impulse of affection with
which, just before, as soon as Peter heard from John that it
was the Lord standing on the shore, "he girt his coat about
him and cast himself into the sea," for his love waited not
for the slowness of the boat. Thus He taught Peter that
the chiefship to which He was appointing him, that "care
of all the Churches," as it required a different spirit to fulfil
it from that which prevailed among "the kings of the
nations," so it led to a different end, the last crowning act
of a lifelong self-sacrifice, which began by being the servant
of all, ran through a thousand acts of humiliation and
anxiety, and was to be completed in the martyrdom of
crucifixion. And so in his death, as well as in his charge
of visible head of the Church, he was to be made like his
Lord, and after the manner of the Good Shepherd, whom
he succeeded, should lay down his life for his sheep. For
"this He said signifying by what death he should glorify
God. And when He had said this, He saith to him, Follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
Me." With far deeper meaning now than when those
words of power were first uttered to him beside that lake.
Then it was, "Follow Me, and I will make you fishers of
men." Now it is, "Follow Me, and I will associate thee
with My life and with My death, with My charge and with
its reward. This shall be the proof of thy greater love, to
be obedient even to death, and that the death of the cross."
Such was the anointing which the first Primate of the
Church received to the triple crown. "Follow thou Me."
Like his divine Master, he was during the whole of his
ministry to have the cross set before his eyes, and laid upon
his heart, as the certain end of his course. And thus Peter
"received power and sacerdotal authority over all, from the
very God for our sakes incarnate:"<a name="FNanchor_27_165" id="FNanchor_27_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_165" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> thus he followed in
the steps of the Good Shepherd, as he succeeded to His
office. And, therefore, having accomplished his mission
and triumphed on the Roman hill, from Rome he speaks
through the undying line of his spiritual heirs, and feeds
the flock of Christ.</p>

<h3>THE CORRESPONDENCE AND EQUIVALENCE OF THE GREAT TEXTS
CONCERNING PETER.</h3>


<p>Before we compare together more exactly what was said
to the Apostles in common, and what to Peter in particular,
it is desirable to consider briefly two other points, which
will complete the evidence furnished by the Gospels.</p>

<p>1. If, then, the<a name="FNanchor_1_166" id="FNanchor_1_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_166" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> question to be decided by documents
is, whether several persons are to be accounted equal in
rank, honour, and authority, or whether one of them is
superior to the rest, it will be an unexceptionable rule to
observe whether they are spoken of in the same manner.
For words are signs of ideas, and set forth as in a mirror
the mind's conceptions. A similarity of language, therefore,
will indicate a similarity of rank; a distinction of language,
especially if it be repeated and constant, will show a like
distinction of rank. Let us apply this rule to the mode in
which the Evangelists speak of Peter and of the other
Apostles.</p>

<p>Now to express one of rank and his attendants, the
Evangelists often use the phrase, a person <i>and those with
him</i>. Thus, Luke vi. 4, "David and <i>those that were with
him</i>;" and Matt. xii. 3 with Mark ii. 25, "Have ye not
read what David did, when himself was a hungered and
<i>those that were with him</i>?" Of our Lord and the Apostles
it is said, Mark iii. 11, "And He made twelve, <i>that they
should be with Him</i>:" and xvi. 10, "She went and told <i>them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>that had been with Him</i>." And Acts iv. 13, the chief
priests "knew them," Peter and John, "that <i>they had been
with Jesus</i>." And Matthew xxvi. 69, Peter is reproached,
"Thou also <i>wast with Jesus</i>." Now just so the Evangelists
speak of Peter. Our Lord having on one occasion left
the Apostles for solitary prayer, S. Mark writes, i. 36,
"And Simon <i>and they that were with him</i> followed after
Him." Again, the woman with the issue of blood having
touched the Lord, when He asked, 'Who is it that touched
Me?' S. Luke says, viii. 45, "all denying, Peter <i>and they
that were with him</i> said," &amp;c. And on the occasion of the
Transfiguration, "Peter and <i>they that were with him</i>,"
being James and John. Just as after the resurrection Luke
writes, Acts ii. 14, "Peter standing up with the eleven;"
verse 37, "They said to Peter and to the rest of the Apostles;"
v. 29, "Peter and the Apostles answering said."
And the angels to the holy women, Mark xvi. 7, "Go tell
His disciples and Peter."</p>

<p>It is then to be remarked that Peter is the <i>only</i> Apostle
who is put in this relation to the rest. <i>Never</i> is it said
"James," or "John and the rest of the Apostles," or,
"and those with him." Peter is named, and the rest are
added in a mass, and this happens in his case continually,
never in the case of any other Apostle.</p>

<p>No adequate cause can be alleged for this but the Primacy
and superior rank of Peter, which was ever in the
mind of the Evangelists, and is sometimes indicated by the
prophetic name; for as often as Simon is called Peter, he is
marked as the foundation of the Church, according to the
Lord's prophecy. And long before contentions about the
prerogatives of Peter arose, the ancient Fathers attributed
it to his Primacy, that he was thus named expressly and
first, the others in a mass, or in the second place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>According, then, to the rule above-mentioned, Peter, by
the mode in which the Evangelists speak of him, is distinguished
from the other Apostles, and his position with
regard to the rest is described in the very same phrase
which is used to express the superiority of David over his
men, and even of our Lord over the Twelve. And for this
there seems no adequate cause, but that special association
of Peter with Himself indicated in the name, and the promises
accompanying it in Matt. xvi.</p>

<p>2. Again, four<a name="FNanchor_2_167" id="FNanchor_2_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_167" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> catalogues of the Apostles exist,<a name="FNanchor_3_168" id="FNanchor_3_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_168" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and
in each of these Peter is placed first. And in the three
which occur in the Gospels, (that of Luke in the Acts
being a more brief repetition of his former one,) the prophetic
name Peter is indicated as the reason for his being
thus placed first. So Mark. "And to Simon He gave the
name Peter. And James the son of Zebedy, and John the
brother of James; and He named them Boanerges, which
is, the sons of thunder:" for which reason, that the
Lord had given them a name, though it was held in
common, and not, like that of Peter, expressive of official
rank, but personal qualities, Mark seems to set these
two before Andrew, whom both in Matthew and in Luke
they follow. Again, Luke says, "He chose twelve of
them, whom also He named Apostles, Simon whom He
surnamed Peter, and Andrew his brother," &amp;c. "<i>The
first</i> of all, and the chief of them, he that was illiterate and
uneducated," says S. Chrysostome;<a name="FNanchor_4_169" id="FNanchor_4_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_169" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and Origen long before
him, observing that Peter was always named first in the
number of the twelve, asks, What should be thought the
cause of this order? He replies, it was constantly observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>because Peter was "more honoured than the rest," thus
intimating that he no less excelled the rest on account of
the gifts which he had received from heaven, than "Judas
through his wretched disposition was truly the last of all,
and worthy to be put at the end."<a name="FNanchor_5_170" id="FNanchor_5_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_170" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But much more
marked is Matthew in signifying the superior dignity of
Peter, not only naming him at the head in his catalogue,
but calling him simply and absolutely "the first." "And
the names of the twelve Apostles are these, The first,
Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother,
James," &amp;c. Now that <i>second</i> and <i>third</i> do not follow,
shows that "first" is not a numeral here, but designates
rank and pre-eminence. Thus in heathen authors this
word "first" by itself indicates the most excellent in its
kind: thus in the Septuagint occur, "first friend of the
king," "first of the singers," "the first priest,"<a name="FNanchor_6_171" id="FNanchor_6_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_171" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> i.e. the
chief priest. So our Lord, "whichever among you will be
first;" "Bring forth the first robe;" and S. Paul, "sinners, of
whom I am first,"<a name="FNanchor_7_172" id="FNanchor_7_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_172" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> i.e. chief. Thus "the first of the island,"
Acts, xxviii. 7, means the chief magistrate; and "first"
generally in Latin phraseology, the superior, or prince.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the rank which Matthew gives to Peter,
when he writes, "the first, Simon, who is called Peter."</p>

<p>It should also be remarked that, whenever the Evangelists
have occasion to mention <i>some</i> of the Apostles, Peter
being one, he is ever put first. Thus Matt., "He taketh
unto Him Peter, and James, and John his brother;" and
Mark, "He admitted not any man to follow Him, but
Peter, and James, and John, the brother of James:" and
"Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew asked Him
apart:" and "He taketh Peter, and James, and John with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Him:" and Luke, "He suffered not any man to go in
with him, but Peter, and James, and John, and the father
and mother of the maiden:" and "He sent Peter and
John:" and John, "There were together Simon Peter,
and Thomas, who is called Didymus, and Nathaniel,
who was of Cana in Galilee, and the two sons of Zebedy,
and two others of His disciples."<a name="FNanchor_8_173" id="FNanchor_8_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_173" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This rule would seem
to be invariable, though James and John are not always
mentioned next after him.</p>

<p>An attempt has been made to evade the force of these
testimonies, by giving as a reason for Peter being always
thus named first, that he was the most aged of all the
Apostles, and the first called. Even were it so, such
reasons would seem most inadequate, but unfortunately
they are neither of them facts. For as to age, antiquity
bears witness that Andrew was Peter's elder brother. And
as to their calling, S. Augustine has observed, "In what
order all the twelve Apostles were called, does not appear
in the narrations of the Evangelists, since not only not the
order of the calling, but not even the calling itself of all is
mentioned, but only of Philip, and Peter, and Andrew, and
of the sons of Zebedy, and of Matthew, the publican,
termed also Levi. But Peter was both the first and the
only one who separately received a name from Him."<a name="FNanchor_9_174" id="FNanchor_9_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_174" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> As
it may be conjectured from the Gospels that Christ said to
Philip first of all, "Follow Me," Joh. i. 44, he has the best
right to be considered the first called.</p>

<p>Now the two classes of facts just mentioned, as to the
mode in which the Evangelists speak of Peter in combination
with the other Apostles, prove directly and plainly his
<i>Primacy</i>, while they do not <i>directly</i> prove, save Matthew's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>title of <i>First</i>, nor are they here quoted to prove, the <i>nature</i>
of that Primacy, which rests, as we have seen, on other and
more decisive texts.</p>

<p>At length, then, we have before us the whole evidence
of the Gospels, and having considered it piece by piece,
may now take a general view. It is time to gather up the
several parts of this evidence, and, claiming for each its due
force, to present the sum of all before the mind. For distinct
and decisive as certain texts appear, and are, even by
themselves, yet when they are seen to fit into a whole system,
and perfectly to harmonise together, they have much
greater power to convince the mind, which really seeks
for truth. But moral evidences generally, and especially
that which results from a study of the Holy Scripture, is
not intended to move a mind in a lower condition than
this; a mind, that is, which loves something else better than
the truth.</p>

<p>Thus, out of the body of His disciples, we see our Lord
choosing Twelve, and again, out of those Twelve, distinguishing
One by the most singular favours. This distinction
even begins <i>before</i> the selection of the Twelve, and has
its root in the very commencement of our Lord's ministry:
for, as we have seen, it was when Andrew first led his
brother Simon before Christ, that He "looked upon him,"
and promised him the prophetic name which revealed his
Primacy, and his perpetual relation to the Church of God.
The name thus promised is in due time bestowed, and
solemnly recorded by the three Evangelists, at the appointment
of the Apostles, as the reason why he is invariably
set at their head; Matthew, still more distinctly expressing
in it his primacy, "<i>the first</i>, Simon, who is called Peter."
And their whole mode of mentioning him, and exhibiting
his relation to the other apostles, shews that this Primacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
was, when they wrote, ever in their minds. It comes out
in the most incidental way, as when Mark writes, "Simon,
and they that were with him, followed after" Christ; or
Luke, "Peter, and they that were with him, said;" as
naturally as they write, "David, and those that were with
him:" or of our Lord Himself, and the Apostles, "those
that had been with Him."<a name="FNanchor_10_175" id="FNanchor_10_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_175" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>  Again this preference of
Peter is shewn by our Lord, both at the Transfiguration
and the Agony: where, even when the two next favoured
of the Apostles are associated with Him as witnesses, yet
there is evidence of Peter's superiority in the mode
with which the Evangelists mention him. Great as the
dignity was of the two sons of thunder, they are yet ranged
under Peter by Luke, with that same phrase which we
have just been considering. "Peter, and they that were
with him were heavy with sleep." And our Lord, at the
agony, says to Peter, "could not <i>you</i>," that is, all the three,
"watch with Me one hour?"<a name="FNanchor_11_176" id="FNanchor_11_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_176" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>  Again, how incidentally, yet
markedly, does Matthew shew that this superiority of Peter
over others was apparent even to strangers, when he writes,
that the officers who collected the tribute for the temple,
came to <i>him</i>, and said, "does not <i>your</i> master" (the master
of all the Apostles,) "pay the didrachma?"<a name="FNanchor_12_177" id="FNanchor_12_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_177" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>  Much more
significant is the incident immediately following, when our
Lord orders him to go to the sea, to cast a hook, and to
bring up a fish, which shall have a stater in his mouth,
adding, "take that, and give it to them for Me, and for
thee:" a token of preference so strong, and of association
so singular, that it set the Apostles on the immediate
enquiry, who should be the greater among them: the
answer to which we will revert to presently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p><p>And this designation of Peter to his high and singular
office becomes even more striking, if we contrast what our
Lord did and said to him with what He did and said to
another Apostle, who <i>in another way</i> is even in some respects
preferred to Peter himself. For "the disciple whom
Jesus loved," who lay on His breast at supper, to whom was
committed at the most sorrowful of all moments the domestic
care of the Virgin Mother, has in the affection of our
Lord his own unapproachable sphere. But as Peter does
not come into competition with him here, so neither in
another view he with Peter. His distinction is private, and
in the nature of personal affection: Peter's is public, and
in the nature of Church government. To one is committed
the Mother of the Lord, the living symbol of the Church,
the most blessed of all creatures, and that, when her full
dignity and blessedness stood at length revealed in the full
Godhead of her Son, yet whose throne was intercessory,
apart from rule on earth: to the other is committed the
Church herself, her championship in the time of conflict,
the rudder of the vessel on the lake, till with Christ it
should reach the shore. Each of these, so eminent and
unapproachable in his way, has that way apart; and when
Peter, on receiving his final commission, turned about and
saw his best-loved friend following, and ventured to ask,
"Lord, and what shall this man do?" our Lord replied with
something like a reproof, "what is that to thee? Follow
thou Me." These distinct preferences of the two Apostles
were indicated by Tertullian, when he wrote, "Was
anything concealed from Peter, who was named the rock
on which the Church should be built, who received the
keys of the kingdom of heaven, and the power to bind
and loose in heaven and on earth? Was anything, too,
concealed from John, the most beloved of the Lord, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
lay upon His breast, to whom alone the Lord foresignified
the traitor Judas, whom He committed in His own
place as Son to Mary?"<a name="FNanchor_13_178" id="FNanchor_13_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_178" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>But to return. Our Lord, after encompassing Peter
during His whole ministry with such tokens of preference,
and a preference specially belonging to his office, and designating
it, appears to him first of all the Apostles after
His resurrection. And yet all the proofs which we have
been here summing up of Peter's pre-eminence, are but
collateral and subordinate: though by themselves ten-fold
more than any other can claim, yet Peter's authority does
not rest <i>mainly</i> on them. And this likewise is true of
another class of facts concerning Peter, which yet carries
with it much force, and when once remarked, never leaves
the thoughtful mind. It is his great predominance in the
sacred history over the rest of the Twelve. A single incident
or expression distinguishing him, is perhaps all that
falls to the lot of another Apostle, as when "Philip saith
unto Him, Lord, show us the Father and it sufficeth us;"
and the Lord replies, "Have I been so long time with
you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip?" Or as
Thomas, at a moment of danger, "said to his fellow disciples,
Let us also go that we may die with Him."<a name="FNanchor_14_179" id="FNanchor_14_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_179" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>  But
Peter's name is wrought into the whole tissue of the Gospel
history; he is perpetually approaching the Lord with
questions: "Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against
me, and I forgive him? until seven times?" The rest
suffer the Lord in silence to wash their feet, but Peter is
overcome at the sight. "Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?
Thou shalt never wash my feet;" "Lord, not my feet
only, but also my hands and my head."<a name="FNanchor_15_180" id="FNanchor_15_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_180" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Thus in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>whole New Testament, John, who is yet mentioned oftener
than the rest, occurs only thirty-eight times; but in the
Gospels alone, omitting the Acts and the Epistles, Peter
is mentioned twenty-three times by Matthew, eighteen
by Mark, twenty by Luke, and thirty by John.<a name="FNanchor_16_181" id="FNanchor_16_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_181" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>  More
especially it is the custom of the Evangelists, when they
record anything which touches all the Apostles, almost
invariably to exhibit Peter as singly speaking for all, and
representing all. Thus when Christ asked them all
equally, "But whom say ye that I am? Simon Peter
answered and said."  He told them all equally "That a
rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven,"<a name="FNanchor_17_182" id="FNanchor_17_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_182" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
whereupon "Peter answering said to Him, Behold, we have
left all things, and followed Thee: what therefore shall we
have?"  And when "Jesus said to the twelve, Will you
also go away?"<a name="FNanchor_18_183" id="FNanchor_18_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_183" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> at once we hear, "Simon Peter answered
and said, Lord, to whom shall we go?  Thou
hast the words of eternal life."  And a very remarkable
occasion occurs where our Lord had been telling to His
disciples the parable of the watchful servant, upon which
Peter said to Him, "Lord, dost Thou speak this parable
to us, or likewise to all?"<a name="FNanchor_19_184" id="FNanchor_19_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_184" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>  And the reply seems by
anticipation to express the very office which Peter was to
hold. "Who, then, is the faithful and wise steward, whom
his lord setteth over his family, to give them their
measure of wheat in due season?"  Now it looks not like
an equal, but a superior, to anticipate the rest, to represent
them, to speak and act for them.  S. Chrysostome
drew the conclusion long ago.  "What then says Peter,
the mouth-piece of the Apostles?  Everywhere impetuous
as he is, the leader of the band of the Apostles, when a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>question is asked of all, he replies."<a name="FNanchor_20_185" id="FNanchor_20_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_185" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>  No other cause can be
assigned for the care of the Evangelists in setting before us
so continually his words and acts, in bringing him out, as
the second object, after Christ. But though his future place
in the Church is a reason for this, and this again, a token of
that singular pre-eminence, its decisive proof rests on declarations
from our Lord's own mouth, expressly circumscribed
to him, of singular lucidity, and of force which nothing can
evade; declarations which set forth, under different but
coincident images, a power supreme and without equal, and
of its own nature belonging to but one at a time. The
proofs which we have hitherto mentioned take away all
abruptness from these declarations, and show that they
embody a great design which runs all through the Gospel;
but the office itself rests upon these, and by these is most
clearly and absolutely defined.</p>

<p>Thus, when our Lord, in answer to a great confession of
His Apostle, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living
God," replies, "and I too, say unto thee, Thou art Peter,
and upon this rock I will build My Church:" every one
must feel how it adds to the cogency of the reply, that the
name, which He is explaining, was not the person's natural
name, but first promised, and then given, by that same
Lord, who now attaches other promises and prophecies to
it. This fact serves, among others, to fix the whole which
follows to Peter individually, and to introduce what follows,
as part of a design, which before had been intimated: for
what follows no more belongs to the other Apostles, than
the name, Peter, belongs to them: and a name, on the
other hand, so promised, and so given, naturally looks, as
it were, to such a result. To say solemnly of a man, when
first seen, "Thou art called Simon, but thou shall be called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>The Rock," and to make nothing of him when so called,
would be, if ascribed to any one, a dull and pointless thing;
but what shall we say, when the speaker is God? It is a
new thing for God the Word to speak with little meaning,
or to speak, and not to do: and so now He does what He
had long designed. And what is it that He does? He sets
up a governor who is never to be put down. He inaugurates
a Church against which Hell shall rage, but in vain:
He establishes a government at which the nations shall
rage, the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers
take counsel together, for ever, but to their own confusion.
He does what He alone could do, and so the answer is
worthy of the confession, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of
the living God."</p>

<p>"Blessed <a name="FNanchor_21_186" id="FNanchor_21_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_186" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>art thou, Simon Bar-Jonas, for flesh and
blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but My Father who
is in heaven. <i>And I, too, say unto thee</i>, in return for
what thou hast said to Me, and to shew, like My Father,
My good will towards thee, and what I say, as the Almighty
Word of the Father, by My power I fulfil, <i>that thou art
Peter</i>, the Rock, and so partaker with Me of that honour
whereby I am the chief Rock and Foundation; <i>and upon
this Rock</i>, which I have called thee, <i>I will build My
Church</i>, which, therefore, with Me for its architect, shall
rest on thee, to thee adhere, and from thee derive its conspicuous
unity: <i>and the gates of hell</i>, even all the powers
of the enemy, <i>shall not prevail against it</i>, nor take that,
which, by My Godhead, is established upon thee, but rather
yield to it the victory. <i>And to thee</i>, whom, as Supreme
Architect, I have marked out for the Rock and Foundation
of My Church, as King and Lord <i>I will give the keys of
the kingdom of heaven</i>, and the supreme authority over My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>Church, and will make thee sharer with Me in that dignity,
by which I hold the keys of heaven and of earth, <i>and whatsoever</i>,
in virtue of that authority and as associated in My
dignity, <i>thou shalt bind upon earth, shall be bound in
heaven</i>, and there shall be no matter relating to My
Church, and the kingdom of heaven, but shall be subject
to thy legislative and judicial power, which shall reach the
heaven itself: for it is a power at once human, and divine;
human, as entrusted to a man, and administered by a man;
divine, as a participation of that right by which I am, in
heaven and on earth, Supreme Lawgiver and Judge; <i>and
whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth, shall be loosed in
heaven</i>."</p>

<p>Thus it is that the most famous Fathers and Bishops, the
most distinguished Councils, the most various nations, have
understood our Lord's words, and this is their meaning,
according to the fixed laws of grammar, of rhetoric, of
philosophy, and of logic, as well as by the testimony of
history, and in accordance with the principles of theology.
Let us mention certain consequences which follow from
them.</p>

<p>These words<a name="FNanchor_22_187" id="FNanchor_22_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_187" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> of Christ are, in the most marked manner,
addressed to Peter <i>only</i> among the Apostles, and are,
therefore, with their meaning, <i>peculiar</i> to him. And they
designate pre-eminence in the government of the Church.
They have, therefore, the two qualities which render them
a suitable testimony to establish his Primacy among the
Apostles.</p>

<p>Now, if persons differ in rank and pre-eminence, they
must be considered not equals, but absolutely unequal.
And such pre-eminence Peter had, deriving from Christ,
the Founder, a superior rank in the Church's ministry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>Therefore, the college of the Apostles must be termed
absolutely unequal, and all the Apostles, compared with
Peter, absolutely unequal.</p>

<p>But as inequality may be manifold, as of age, calling,
honour, order, jurisdiction and power, its nature and its
degree must be sought in that property which belongs to
one over the rest. So that we must determine, by the
authority of the Scriptures, from those gifts which were
promised to Peter alone, the nature and the degree of
that inequality which subsisted between him and the other
Apostles.</p>

<p>The gifts promised to Peter alone, are contained in these
words of Christ, recorded by Matthew: and therefore, from
their nature and inherent qualities, we must judge of the
sort, and the extent of inequality, put by Christ between
Peter and the rest.</p>

<p>These are summed up in the four following: I. That
Peter is the rock, on which the Church was to be built by
Christ, the Chief Architect. II. That the impregnable
strength which the Church was to have against the gates
of hell, depended on its union with Peter, as the divinely
laid foundation. III. That by Christ, the King of kings,
and Lord of lords, Peter is marked out as next to Him,
and after Him, the Bearer of the keys in the Church's
heavenly kingdom: IV. And that, accordingly, universal
power of binding and loosing is promised to him, leaving
him responsible to Christ alone, the supreme Lawgiver and
Judge. Therefore the nature of the prerogatives expressed
in these four terms must be our standard both of the
character and degree of inequality between the Apostles
and Peter, and of the power of the Primacy promised to
Peter.</p>

<p>But these terms mark authority, and plainly express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
jurisdiction and power; the inequality, therefore, is one
relating to jurisdiction and power; and Peter's pre-eminence
likewise such.</p>

<p>That these terms, which contain Peter's prerogatives
really do express jurisdiction and authority, may be thus
very briefly shown. The first, "Thou art Peter, and upon
this rock I will build My Church," is drawn from architecture,
exhibiting between Peter and the Church, which
includes also the Apostles, the relation which exists between
the foundation and the superstructure. This is one
of dependence, by which accordingly the Apostles must
maintain an indivisible union with Peter. Which relation
of dependence, again, cannot be understood without the
notion of superior jurisdiction in Peter, for these are correlative.
The second term corroborates this; for it is a
plain duty, and undoubted moral obligation, to be united
to him, if severed from whom, the words of Christ do not
entitle you to expect stability or victory over the gates of
hell. Now, "the gates of hell shall not prevail against it,"
most plainly express that perseverance and victory are
promised to no one by Christ, who does not remain joined
with Peter. So much for the <i>duty</i> which binds all Christians,
and the Apostles among them, to avoid separation
from Peter as their destruction. But such duty involves
the faculty and authority on Peter's part of enjoining on
all without exception the maintenance of unity, and of
keeping from the whole body the sin of schism, which,
again, expresses his superior jurisdiction. Yet plainer and
more striking is the <i>third</i>; for in the words, "And I will
give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven," it is foretold
that Peter, in regard to the kingdom of heaven, and
therefore to all Christians, whether teachers or taught,
subjects or prelates, shall discharge the office of the bearer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of the keys; with which jurisdiction and authority are indivisibly
united. But in the <i>fourth</i>, there is no matter
relating to the heavenly kingdom, which is not subjected
by this promise to Peter's authority. "Whatsoever thou
shalt bind," "whatsoever thou shalt loose;" but this is in
its own kind without limit, a full legislative and judicial
power. Thus these four terms exactly agree with each
other, and express, severally and collectively, prerogatives
by which Peter is admitted to a singular and close association
with Christ; and therefore is pre-eminent among
the Apostles by his Primacy, and his superior authority
over the whole Church.</p>

<p>They also show, with no less clearness, that Christ in bestowing
these prerogatives and primacy on Peter, designed
to produce the visible unity of His kingdom and Church;
and this in two ways, the first <i>typically prefiguring</i> the
Church's own unity in Peter, the single Foundation, Bearer
of the keys, and supreme Legislator and Judge; the
second <i>efficiently</i>, as by a principle and cause, <i>forming</i>,
<i>holding together</i>, and <i>protecting</i>, visible unity in that
same Peter, as he discharged these functions. For just
as the building is based on the foundation, and by virtue
of it all the parts are held together, so a kingdom's unity
and harmonious administration are first <i>moulded out</i>, and
then <i>preserved</i>, in the unity of its supreme authority.</p>

<p>And this Primacy may be regarded from three different
points of view; as it <i>is in itself</i>, and as it regards its
<i>efficient</i> and its <i>final</i> cause. As to the first, it consists in
superior jurisdiction and authority; as to the second, it
springs from Christ Himself, who said to Peter alone,
"And I too say unto thee," &amp;c.; as to the third, it <i>prefigures</i>,
<i>forms</i>, and <i>protects</i> the Church's visible unity.</p>

<p>But to prefigure, to form, and to protect the Church's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
unity being distinct functions, care must be taken not to
confuse them, the former concerning the Primacy as a
type, the two latter as the origin and efficient cause; and
also not to concede the former while the latter are denied,
which latter make up the Primacy as jurisdictional, and
the instrument effecting unity. Now Peter is both the
type of unity, its origin, and its efficient cause.</p>

<p>A long line<a name="FNanchor_23_188" id="FNanchor_23_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_188" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> of fathers, from the most ancient downwards,
regards Peter as at once the type, and the origin, and
efficient cause of unity; setting it forth as a prerogative
of his headship that no one, whether Apostle, or Prophet,
or Evangelist, or Doctor, or Teacher, might separate from
him without the crime of schism. In this consists his
Primacy, and in this the famous phrase of S. Cyprian
finds its solution, that "the Episcopate is one, of which a
part is held by each without division of the whole."</p>

<p>And, what is like to the preceding, they hold that Peter
is the <i>continuous</i> source of all power in the Church, and
that while its plenitude dwells in his person, a portion of
it is derived to the various prelates under him. No one
has set this forth more fully than S. Leo, in the middle of
the fifth century, as where he says, that "if Christ willed
that other rulers should enjoy aught together with him,
(that is, Peter,) yet never did He give, <i>save through him</i>,
what He denied not to others."<a name="FNanchor_24_189" id="FNanchor_24_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_189" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>There is no one of these consequences but seems to
result from the words of our Lord here solemnly addressed
to Peter.</p>

<p>But, recurring to our general view, we find our Lord
three several<a name="FNanchor_25_190" id="FNanchor_25_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_190" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> times appealed to by the Apostles to declare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>who should be the greatest in the kingdom of heaven; and
while on neither of these occasions does He declare to them
that there should be no "greater one" among them, though
such a declaration would have terminated their rivalry, on
the last and most urgent, at the very eve of His departure
from them, He sets forth in vivid words what ought to be
the character and deportment of the one so to be placed
over them; and then turning His conversation from them
in a body to Peter in particular, He charges him, at a
future time, when He shall obtain for him the gift of a
faith that could not fail, to "confirm his brethren." Having
before dwelt on the full meaning of these words, we
need only remark how marvellously they coincide in force
with the prophecy which we have just been considering,
while they differ from it in expression. They convey as
absolutely a supreme authority as the former; and an
authority independent of others, and exclusive of participation;
and one which is given for the maintenance of the
faith, and of visible unity in that faith. Nor can we
imagine a more fitting termination to the whole of our
Lord's dealing with His disciples before His passion, than
that, when about to be taken from them, He should designate,
in words so full of affection and provident care, one
who was presently to take His own place among them.
"Simon, Simon, I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail
not, and thou in thy turn one day confirm thy brethren."</p>

<p>But if our Lord's preference of Peter, as to rank and
dignity in the Church, was during his lifetime consistent
and uniform; if, moreover, He made to him, twice, promises
so large as to include and go far beyond all that He
said to the Apostles in common; and if He took out, as it
were, of what He had first promised to Peter a portion
which He afterwards promised as their common inheritance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to the rest; His dealing with Peter and the Apostles
after His resurrection is the exact counterpart to this.
The fulfilment is equivalent to the promise. In the fourfold
prophecy to Peter, in Matt. xvi. the last member is,
"And whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, it shall be
bound also in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on
earth, it shall be loosed also in heaven." That this is a
grant of full legislative and judicial power, given to one,
we have seen. Now on a later occasion it is repeated to the
twelve together, Matt. xviii. 18. <i>But the other three members
of the prophecy made to Peter are never repeated to
the twelve</i>. In the fulfilment the same distinction takes
place. To the twelve in common our Lord communicates
the power contained in the fourth member of His original
promise, saying, John xx. 21, "As the Father hath sent
Me, I also send you. Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose
sins ye shall forgive, they are forgiven them: and whose
sins ye shall retain, they are retained:" to which the
other forms contained in Matt. xxviii. 18, Mark xvi. 15,
Luke xxiv. 49, Acts i. 4, 8, of preaching the Gospel to
every creature, of waiting for the power of the Holy Ghost
wherewith they should be endued, of teaching men to
observe all things which He had commanded, are equivalent,
though less definite. <i>But nowhere are the powers
contained in the first three members of the prophecy to
Peter communicated to the twelve</i>. As the promises were
made to Peter alone originally, so to Peter alone are they,
as we shall see, fulfilled. Indeed, it could not be otherwise,
for the promises to be the rock of the Church, by coherence
with which the Church should be impregnable, and
the bearer of the keys, are in their own nature confined
to one, and exclusive of participants, and once made by
the very Truth Himself to one man, they ranged under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
his power all his brethren: "For the promises of Jesus
Christ, as well as His gifts, are without repentance;
and what is once given indefinitely and universally is
irrevocable."<a name="FNanchor_26_191" id="FNanchor_26_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_191" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>  Besides that, another indisputable principle
must be taken into account, viz., "that power given
to several carries its restriction in its division:" just as
if a king before his death bequeaths the whole administration
of his sovereignty to a board of twelve councillors,
though the sum of authority so conveyed be sovereign,
yet the share of each individual in the college will be
restricted by the equal right of his colleagues. Whereas
"power given to one alone, and over all, and without
exception, carries with it plenitude, and, not having to
be divided with any other, it has no bounds save those
which its terms convey." Such was the power originally
promised to Peter; and such, no less, that which was
ultimately conveyed. He stands apart and alone no less
in the fulfilment than in the promise. And under another
image, but one equally expressive with the first, the Lord
conveys an authority as absolute and as exclusive. The
"bounds which its terms convey" are the whole fold of
Christ: "the sheep" no less than "the lambs:" "to
govern" no less than "to feed."<a name="FNanchor_27_192" id="FNanchor_27_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_192" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> As the great Architect
of the heavenly city said to Peter, "Thou art the
Rock;" as "the King of kings," who "hath the key of
David," and "on whose shoulder is the government,"
said to Peter, "To thee will I give the keys of the kingdom
of heaven;" as He "who upholdeth all things by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>the word of His power," and "in whom all things consist,"
said to Peter, "Confirm thy brethren:" so to the
same Peter, the same "Great Shepherd of the sheep,"
said, "Feed My lambs, be shepherd over My sheep,"
thus committing to him the chief Apostles themselves who
heard this charge, and causing there to be for ever "one
fold and one shepherd," on earth as in heaven.</p>

<p>It remains briefly to consider these three palmary texts
in their reciprocal relations to each other, by which the
fullest light is thrown upon the scriptural prerogatives of
S. Peter.</p>

<p>1. First, then, all these texts are in the most marked
manner circumscribed to Peter <i>alone</i>. In all he is addressed
by name; in all he is distinguished by other circumstances
from his brethren at the time present with him; in
all a special condition is attached belonging to him; in the
first, superior faith&mdash;in the second, faith, which, by a particular
gift, the fruit of Christ's own prayer, should never
fail&mdash;in the third, superior love. So that, without an utter
disregard of the meaning of words, and the force of the
context, and every law of grammar and philology, no one
of these texts can be extended from its application to Peter
alone, and made common to the other Apostles.</p>

<p>2. Secondly, the note of <i>priority in time</i> is secured to
Peter by the first text, to which the other two correspond.
Even if the promise in Matt. xviii. 18, made to all the
Apostles, were of equal latitude with that previously made
to Peter, which it is so very far from being that it contains
one point only out of four, yet, the fact that they had been
already ranged by the former under him, and that he had
been promised <i>singly</i> what they afterwards were promised
<i>in common</i>, would make a vast difference between them;
indeed, the difference of the Primacy. But, as it is, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
very first mention of the Church is connected with a promise
made to Peter of the highest authority in that Church,
and a perpetual relationship, entering into its inmost constitution,
between it and his person. Before the Church is
formed, it is foretold that Peter shall rule her: before she
is set up against the gates of hell, that, by virtue of her
coherence with Him, she should prevail over them. And
the germ of her Episcopate, on which she is to grow, is
sown in His person; just as, in the last act of our Lord,
that Episcopate is delivered over to Him, universal and
complete.</p>

<p>3. Thirdly, those three texts are exactly <i>equivalent</i> to
each other: they each involve and express the other. They
could not have been said of different persons without contradiction
and confusion. He who has one of them must
have the rest. There is variation of image, but identity of
meaning. Thus, the relation between Peter and the Church
is in the first, that of Foundation and Superstructure;
of the heaven-built city, and of him who holds its keys:
in the second, it is that of the Architect, who, by skill and
authority, won for him, and given to him, by the Supreme
Builder, the Word and Wisdom of God, maintains every
living stone of the structure in its due place: in the third
it is that of the supreme and universal Pastor and his whole
flock. In all of these there is the habit of dependence
between the superior and that over which he is set: in all
the need of close coherence with him. Observe in particular
the identity of the second and third. The special
office of the Shepherd of<a name="FNanchor_28_193" id="FNanchor_28_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_193" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> souls is to lead his flock into
suitable pastures, that is, duly to instruct them in the
Divine Word and Will: the pastoral office is identical
with that of teaching: "He gave some Apostles, some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>Prophets, some Evangelists, some pastors and teachers,"
the former are distinguished, the last united together:
where the Apostle observes, that the whole ministry, from
the highest to the lowest, is organised "to edify the body
of Christ into the unity of faith," and to preserve men
from being "carried about by every wind of doctrine."
But if this was the design of Christ as to the whole
ministry, and as to each individual teacher, most of all
was it in instituting one supreme and universal Pastor: in
him most of all would be seen the perfect <i>fitting in
together</i><a name="FNanchor_29_194" id="FNanchor_29_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_194" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of each individual member: he was set up
especially for the compacting of each spiritual joint, the
harmony and cohesion of the whole. Here, then, the
office of the universal Pastor or Teacher is precisely
equivalent to him, who, by another image confirms,
strengthens, consolidates his brethren. Thus, in the
second text Christ foretold the third. But the more
we contemplate all the three in their mutual relations,
the more a certain thought suggests itself to the mind.
There is a special doctrine concerning the most Holy
Trinity, the most distinctive of that great mystery, which
expresses the reciprocal indwelling of the Three Persons.
Now something analogous may be said of the way in
which these three texts impermeate and include each
other, of their exact equivalence, and distinct, but inseparable
force: of whom one is said, of the same must all.</p>

<p>4. Fourthly, they all indicate a <i>sovereign</i> authority, <i>independent</i>
itself, but on which all others depend; symbolising
power from above, but claiming obedience from below;
immutable in itself, but by which all the rest are made proof
against change; for it is not to the sheep that the shepherd
is responsible, but to their owner. It has been said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>throughout that the one special mark of Peter's distinction
was a peculiar association with Christ. It is not therefore
by any infringement of equal rights that this authority
is set up, but as the representative, the vicegerent, of
Him in whom all power dwells: who bore this authority in
His own body, and who committed to another what was first
His own, both by creation and by purchase&mdash;"Feed <i>My</i>
sheep." In all these texts the immediate transference of authority
from the Person of the God-man is most striking; in
Peter He inaugurates His great theandric dispensation, and
forms the Body which He was to leave on earth. Thus these
texts most clearly express that important doctrine of antiquity,
the keystone of the Church's liberty from the world,
which is the reason why the world so hates it, "The first See
is judged by no man." So entirely have political ideas and
jealousies infected our mode of judging of spiritual things&mdash;to
such a degree is our peculiar civil liberty made the standard
of Church government&mdash;that it is necessary to insist
again and again on what to Christians ought to be a first
principle, viz., that "all power and jurisdiction in the
Church, like the Church herself, ought to rest not upon
natural and human authority, but on the divine authority
of Christ. This is the reason why we may pronounce no
otherwise concerning such jurisdiction, than we know has
been handed down from Christ, its proper author and
founder. Now it is certain that at the same moment at
which Christ instituted the community called the Church,
such a power was introduced, and entrusted as well to
Peter singly as the head, as to the Apostles under him.
Nay, that power was fixed and constituted, and its ministers
and bishops marked out, <i>before</i> the Church, that is,
the whole body and commonwealth, had grown into coherence.
And so ecclesiastical jurisdiction did not first dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
in the community itself, and was then translated by a sort
of popular suffrage and consent to its magistrates; but from
the very first origin Peter was destined to be single chief of
the future body, and next to him the other Apostles."<a name="FNanchor_30_195" id="FNanchor_30_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_195" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>5. Fifthly, it must be observed that there is a <i>definiteness</i>
about these texts which belongs in a far less degree to
those forms in which the co-ordinate and co-equal authority
of the Apostles, as such, is expressed. This last is left to
be harmonised and brought into operation by the superior
power of the chief. They are indeed sent into all the
world, they are immediately instituted by our Lord, they
have the promise that His power shall be with them, and
that their sentence shall stand good in heaven and on
earth; but this promise, which is the most distinct made to
them, has been already gathered up into the hands of one,
and in its practical issue is limited by the necessity of cooperating
with that one; that is, the authority of Peter
includes and embraces theirs, but theirs is ranged under
his. Theirs is modified not only by being shared, but by
having his set over them. Now observe how distinct and
clear, how definite in their meaning, while universal in
their range, are the things said of him alone; 1. That he
should be the rock on which Christ would build His
Church; 2. That permanence and victory should belong to
that Church for ever through Him: 3. That he should
bear the keys in the kingdom of heaven: 4. That whatever
<i>singly</i> he should bind and loose, should be bound and
loosed in heaven as well as on earth: 5. That he should
confirm his brethren, the Apostles themselves being the
very first so called: 6. That he should be the Shepherd of
the fold. What can constitute inequality between two parties,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>if such a series of promises given to one, and not to
the other, does not?</p>

<p>6. Sixthly, these promises cannot be contemplated without
seeing that the ordinary and regular government of
the Church springs from the person whom they designate,
and in whom they are concentrated. To take the last, all
spiritual care is summed up in the word Pastorship, the
office of priest, bishop, metropolitan, patriarch, and pope,
rising in degree, and extending in range, but in its nature
the same. On the contrary Apostles, (with this one exception,
in virtue of the Primacy,) Prophets, and Evangelists,
are extraordinary officers, attending the opening of the
dispensation, but afterwards dropping off. But the Church,
as it was to endure for ever, and the orderly arrangement
of the divine ministry, were summed up in the Primacy,
and flowed forth from it as the full receptacle of the
virtue of God the Word Incarnate. And so it is the head
of the ministerial body. All which is set forth as in a
picture to the mind, in that scene upon the shore of
the lake of Galilee, when the Lord said to Peter, "Feed
My sheep."</p>

<p>7. And, again, Peter was thus made the beginning
and principle of spiritual power, as it left the Person of
God the Word, not for once, but for ever. Long as
the structure should endure, its principle of cohesion
must bind it. As the law of gravitation binds all worlds
together in the natural kingdom, and is a <i>continuous</i>
source of strength and harmony, so should be in the
spiritual kingdom that force which the same Wisdom of
God established; it goes on with power undiminished; it
is the full fountain-head from which all streams emanate;
it is the highest image of God's power as the centre and
source of all things.  This idea is dwelt upon by S.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Cyprian and S. Augustine, as well as by Pope S. Innocent,<a name="FNanchor_31_196" id="FNanchor_31_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_196" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
the contemporary of the latter, and was afresh
expressed in a synodical letter of the three provinces of
Africa to Pope Theodore, in <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 646, "No one can
doubt that there is in the Apostolic See a great unfailing
fountain, pouring forth waters for all Christians,
whence rich streams proceed, bountifully irrigating the
whole Christian world."<a name="FNanchor_32_197" id="FNanchor_32_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_197" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>8. And, lastly, in these great promises Peter is specially
set forth as the type and the efficient cause of visible
unity in the Church. Such was the very purpose of
Christ, that His disciples might be one, as He and the
Father are one. For this end, in the words of S. Augustine,
"He entrusted His sheep to Peter, as to another
self, He willed to make him one with Himself;" and in
the words of S. Leo, "He assumed him into the participation
of His indivisible unity."<a name="FNanchor_33_198" id="FNanchor_33_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_198" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> But this is seen no
less plainly in the words of Christ, than in the Fathers;
for He made <i>one</i> Rock, <i>one</i> Bearer of the keys, <i>one</i>
Confirmer of the brethren, and <i>one</i> Shepherd. The union
of millions of naturally conflicting wills in the profession
and belief of one doctrine is almost the very highest
work of divine power; and as grace, that is, the Holy
Spirit diffused in the heart, is the inward efficient of
this, so the outward, both symbol and instrument, is the
Primacy, that "other self" which the Lord left in the
world. And as the Church of God through every succeeding
age grows and expands, the need of this power
becomes greater and not less, and reverence to that "single
chair in which unity was to be observed by all,"<a name="FNanchor_34_199" id="FNanchor_34_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_199" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> a more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>imperative virtue, or rather an ever-deepening instinct, of
the Christian mind.</p>

<p>But antiquity itself drew no other conclusions from
the concentration of these great privileges in the person
of Peter. We have but to go back to a time before the
present nationalities of Europe, those jealous foes of
Peter's authority, had come into existence, and we find
the chief men of France, and Spain, and Italy, interpreting
the above texts as we have done. Take one
whose testimony from the circumstances of his life ought
to be above suspicion. John Cassian was by birth a
Scythian, was educated in a monastery at Bethlehem,
travelled through Egypt, and made himself acquainted
with its most distinguished religious men, went to Constantinople,
and was ordained deacon by S. Chrysostome,
and afterwards at Rome priest by Pope Innocent I. On
the capture of Rome by Alaric, he settled at Marseilles,
about the year 410, and there founded two monasteries.
In his work on the Incarnation he says,<a name="FNanchor_35_200" id="FNanchor_35_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_200" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> "Let us ask
him, who is supreme, both as disciple among disciples, and
as teacher among teachers, who, steering the course of
the Roman Church, held the supremacy as well of the
faith as of the priesthood. Tell us, therefore, tell us,
we pray, O Peter, Prince of the Apostles, tell us how
the Churches ought to believe. For just it is that thou,
who wast taught of the Lord, shouldst teach us, and open
to us the door whose key thou hast received. Shut out
all who undermine the heavenly house, and turn away
those who attempt to make an entry through treacherous
caverns and illicit approaches; because it is certain that
no one shall be able to enter the door of the kingdom,
save he to whom the key placed by thee in the Church
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>shall open it. Tell us, therefore, how we ought to believe
that Jesus is the Christ, and to confess our common Lord."
Again, fourteen hundred years ago, Maximus, Bishop of
Turin in that day, confessed by his words, what his
successor of the present day bears witness to by his sufferings:
for he writes of Peter, "As<a name="FNanchor_36_201" id="FNanchor_36_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_201" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> the Good Shepherd
he received the defence of the flock, so that he, who
before had been weak in his own case, might become the
confirmation to all: and he who had been shaken by the
temptation of the question asked him, might be a foundation
to the rest by the stability of his faith. In fine, for
the firmness of his devotion he is called the Rock of the
Churches, as the Lord says, 'Thou art Peter, and upon
this Rock I will build My Church.' For he is called the
Rock, because he was the first to lay the foundations of
the faith among the nations, <i>and, because, as an immoveable
stone, he holds together the framework and the mass
of the whole Christian structure</i>. Peter, therefore, for
his devotion is called the Rock, and the Lord is named the
Rock by His inherent power, as the Apostle says, 'and
they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and
the rock was Christ.' <i>Rightly does he merit to share the
name, who, likewise, merits to share the work.</i>" Again,
far and wide has the lying story been spread by false-hearted
men, who above all things, hate the spiritual
kingdom which God has set up in the world, that Peter's
power has been the growth of gradual encroachment on
the secular authority. Now, long before Pelayo renewed
the Spanish monarchy in the mountains of the Asturias,
and while Augustine, sent by Pope Gregory, was laying
the foundation of the English Church, S. Isidore, Bishop of
Seville, from 598 to 636, the very highest of the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>Spanish doctors, wrote thus explicitly to his colleague at
Toledo:<a name="FNanchor_37_202" id="FNanchor_37_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_202" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> "But as to the question of the equality of the
Apostles, Peter is pre-eminent over the rest, who merited
to hear from the Lord, 'Thou shalt be called Cephas&mdash;Thou
art Peter, and upon this rock I will build My
Church.' And not from any one else, but from the very
Son of God and the Virgin, he was the first to receive the
honour of the pontificate in the Church of Christ, to whom
also, after the resurrection of the Son of God, was said by
the same, 'Feed My lambs,' noting by the name of lambs
the prelates of the churches. And although the dignity of
this power is derived to all Catholic bishops, yet in a more
special manner it remains for ever in the Roman bishop,
who is by a certain singular privilege set as the head over
the other limbs. Whoso, therefore, renders not reverently
to him due obedience, involves himself, as being severed
from the head, in the schism of the Acephali."</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply such authorities of a period
prior to the formation of all the existing European states.
It was the will of God, providing for His Church, that before
the old Roman society was utterly upheaved from its foundations
by the deluge of the Northern tribes, reverence for S.
Peter's throne should be fixed as an immovable rock, on
which a new Christian civilization might be founded. Thus
Pope Gregory II., writing to the Emperor Leo the Isaurian,
about the year 717, only sums up the force and effect of all
preceding tradition, when he says: "The whole West turns
its eyes upon us, and, unworthy though we be, puts complete
trust in us, and in that blessed Peter, whose image you
threaten to overturn, but whom all the kingdoms of the
West count for a God upon earth."<a name="FNanchor_38_203" id="FNanchor_38_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_203" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<h3>S. PETER'S PRIMACY AS EXHIBITED IN THE ACTS.</h3>


<p>The <a name="FNanchor_1_204" id="FNanchor_1_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_204" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>purpose of S. Luke in writing the Acts seems to
have been to set before us the labours and sufferings of the
Apostles in planting and propagating the Church. But he
has divided the book very distinctly into two portions; the
latter, from the thirteenth chapter to the end, with one
short exception, is wholly occupied with the labours of S.
Paul, "the vessel of election," in spreading the faith among
the Gentiles, and so contains the particular history of that
Apostle, and the churches founded by him. The former,
from the beginning to the end of the twelfth chapter, embraces
the history of the Apostles in common, and of the
whole Church, as it rose at Jerusalem, and was spread first
in Judea, then in Samaria, and finally extended to the
Gentiles. The former history, then, is universal; the
latter, particular.</p>

<p>Moreover, to use the words of <a name="FNanchor_2_205" id="FNanchor_2_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_205" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>S. Chrysostome, "we
may here see the promises which Christ made in the Gospels
carried into execution, and the bright light of truth
shining in the very actions, and a great change in the disciples,
arising from the Spirit that had entered into them.&mdash;You
will see here Apostles speeding on the wing over land
and sea, and men once timid and unskilled suddenly
changed into despisers of wealth, and conquerors of glory
and all other passions; you will see them united in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>utmost harmony, without jealousy, which once they had,
without contention for the higher place."</p>

<p>We may say, then, in a word, that the Gospels are a
history of the Head, and the Acts of the mystical Body.
Hence both issue forth from one and the same fountain and
source.  The history of the Head begins with the descent
of the Holy Ghost, whereby Christ was conceived, and <a name="FNanchor_3_206" id="FNanchor_3_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_206" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>"the
race of God and of man became one.  For just as
the union of man with woman joins two families, so upon
Christ assuming flesh, by that flesh the whole Church became
of kin with Christ, Paul became Christ's kinsman, and
Peter, each one of the faithful, all we, every holy person.
Therefore, says Paul, <a name="FNanchor_4_207" id="FNanchor_4_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_207" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>'being the offspring of God,' and
again, 'we are the body of Christ and members in particular,'
that is, through the flesh, which He has assumed, we
are His kinsmen."  Now the history of the Body, proceeding
from the same fountain-head, sets before us the Holy
Spirit, who, by descending first on the teachers, and afterwards
on the disciples, exalts and advances all, and by imparting
Himself, imparts "the proportional deification of
man," that is, "the utmost possible assimilation and union
with God."<a name="FNanchor_5_208" id="FNanchor_5_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_208" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> For "the Spirit works in us by His proper
power, truly sanctifying, and uniting us to Himself into one
frame, and making us partakers of the divine nature:"<a name="FNanchor_6_209" id="FNanchor_6_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_209" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
"becoming as it were a quality of the Godhead in us, and
dwelling in the saints, and abiding for ever."</p>

<p>Now it is <a name="FNanchor_7_210" id="FNanchor_7_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_210" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>manifest that if the first twelve chapters of
the Acts contain the history of the Church from its beginning,
and what the Apostles did for its first formation, its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>growth, and its form of government, all this has the closest
connection with the question as to Peter's prerogatives.
For the historical accounts in the Acts, which exhibit the
<i>execution</i> of Christ's promises and intentions, naturally tend
to set in the fullest light, and to reveal distinctly, whatever
as to the administration of the Church may be less clearly
<i>foretold</i> in the Gospels. For in itself the <i>execution</i> is declaratory
of the <i>enactment</i>, and supplies a safe rule for
understanding and determining the words of institution.
Now, if we apply this rule to the present question, it will
be apparent that those expressions of the Gospel, which we
assigned to the divine institution of the Primacy, cannot be
otherwise received without making the <i>execution</i> in the Acts
at variance with what the Gospels record.</p>

<p>For, take it as a still doubtful hypothesis whether there
exist evangelical testimonies of Peter's <i>institution</i> to be
head and chief of the Apostles. What needs it to turn this
hypothesis into certainty? What should we expect of Peter,
if he really had received from Christ the charge of leading
the other Apostles? What but that he should never follow,
but always be at the head; should close dissensions,
weigh and terminate controversies, punish emergent offences,
maintain the general discipline, give the support of
his counsel and authority in need, and leave undone none
of those functions which accompany the office of head and
supreme ruler? Hence it is plain that there are two
ways, the one absolute, the other hypothetical, by which a
decisive judgment may be drawn from the history of the
Acts, as to whether Peter's Primacy was instituted in the
Gospels. Critics and philosophers are perpetually using
both these tests. Thus, the former, "if a certain work&mdash;say
the epistles of the martyr Ignatius&mdash;be genuine, it ought
to contain certain characteristics. But it does contain these,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and so is genuine."  Or absolutely, "a certain work, the
Epistles of Ignatius, contains all which we should expect in
a genuine work, therefore it is genuine." The latter infer,
"If bodies be moved by the law of gravitation, they would
pass through a certain space under such and such a condition.
But this they do, and accordingly are moved by
gravitation." Or absolutely, "Bodies left to themselves
pass through space under such conditions as they would
follow, if impelled by gravitation. Accordingly they are so
impelled." Now in the parallel case, "If Christ in the
Gospels pre-ordained a form of Church government, which
gathered up the supreme power and visible headship into
Peter's hands, the <i>exercise</i> of such <i>institution</i> ought to be
found in the Acts. But it is so found. Therefore," &amp;c.&mdash;or
again, "No one would expect certain acts from Peter,
unless he were the head of all the Apostles; and all would
fairly expect those acts of Peter, if they recognised him as
so set over all by Christ. Now in the general history of
the Apostles we find such acts recorded of Peter, and that
not partially, here and there, but in a complete series. Accordingly
the history of the rising Church, exhibited in the
first part of the Acts, demands Peter's Primacy for its
explanation; and if we deny that Primacy, and take in
another sense the words recording its institution in the
Gospel, the history becomes unintelligible."</p>

<p>Now this reasoning is conclusive in either way, provided
only that what we have asserted be really found in the
Acts. The proof of this may be either general, or piecemeal
and particular. We will take both in order, beginning
with the former.</p>

<p>1. First, <a name="FNanchor_8_211" id="FNanchor_8_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_211" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>then, we must repeat, as concerns that whole
portion of the Acts containing the history of the universal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Church, and all the Apostles, viz. the first twelve chapters,
a remark before made as to the Gospels, which is, that
Peter simply is more often mentioned than all the rest put
together. For Peter's name occurs more than fifty times,
the others very seldom, and those who are found the oftenest,
John and James, are recorded, the former seven or
eight, the latter three or four times. Yet this is a history
of them all: Luke is recording the common exertions of all
the Apostles in building up the Church. This is the very
distinction between the former and the latter portion of his
book, which is confined to the labours of S. Paul, leaving
aside the rest of the Church. What then is the reason
that Peter, in a general history, is so often brought forward,
and the rest, either singly or in conjunction, so seldom?
Because after our Lord's glorious ascension Peter stood to
the eleven in an analogous position to that held by our
Lord, so long as He was visible, towards the whole college:
because Peter was become the head, and the rest, as members,
were ranged under him.</p>

<p>2.  Such subordination on their part, such pre-eminence
on his,<a name="FNanchor_9_212" id="FNanchor_9_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_212" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Luke shows yet more clearly, whenever he groups
Peter with the rest, by assigning to him the leading place.
It frequently happens to him to speak of Peter and the
rest together, but on no one occasion does he give Peter
any but the first place, and the leading part. Just as the
evangelists do with regard to Christ, and the Apostles and
disciples, so Luke prefers Peter to the rest, to mark a difference
between the rank and office of Peter, and that of
the others.</p>

<p>3.  Luke seems to confirm his readers in such a conclusion
by the form which he follows of mentioning Peter <i>directly</i>,
and the rest <i>obliquely</i> or <i>in a mass</i>. These are instances:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>"In those days Peter, <i>rising up in the midst of the brethren</i>,
said"&mdash;"Peter, <i>standing up with the eleven</i>, lifted up
his voice"&mdash;"They said <i>to Peter and to the rest of the
Apostles</i>"&mdash;"Peter <i>with John</i> fastening his eyes upon him
said, Look upon us."&mdash;"Peter <i>and the Apostles</i> answering,
said."<a name="FNanchor_10_213" id="FNanchor_10_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_213" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Now what form of writing could Luke choose to
refute an opinion about the <i>universal</i> equality of the Apostles?
Or to show Peter as set over the rest, and to satisfy
in this even the most unreasonable? Either the form which
he did choose is calculated to do this, or none such can be
found.</p>

<p>4. Add to this that Peter is represented as speaking and
answering, when the occasion would suggest that all the
Apostles, equally, should disclose their mind. The reproaches
of the unbelieving Jews affected not Peter singly,
but all alike; but he alone stands forth, he alone lifts up
his voice, and in a long speech brings them to sound reflection.
The multitude, struck with compunction, asked
not Peter only, but the rest likewise, "What shall we
do, men and brethren?" Yet it is forthwith added,
"But <i>Peter</i> said to them." Upon the miracle by which
one who had been lame from his mother's womb was
healed, "all the people ran together to them," both
Peter and John, but Peter alone speaks, and takes on
himself the defence of the common cause: "Peter seeing,
made answer to the people."<a name="FNanchor_11_214" id="FNanchor_11_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_214" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Fresh instances may be
found in chs. iv. 6-7, and v. 2-3. The result of the whole
is that Peter is continually "the mouth-piece of the Apostles,"<a name="FNanchor_12_215" id="FNanchor_12_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_215" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
always takes the lead, and gives his own mind, as
conveying that of the rest.</p>

<p>On what ground does he do this? Was it from natural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>fervour of disposition? But it was the same after he was
filled with the Holy Spirit as before. Was it the result of
superior age, or first calling? but the facts refute this.
What other cause can be suggested save that Primacy
which the Gospels record, and the Acts confirm?</p>

<p>5. To this we must likewise refer it that Luke, while he
amply describes actions which belong to Peter, rather hints
at than narrates what concerns the other Apostles. Thus
he leaves it to be understood that the others spoke, while
he gives Peter's discourses entire, and seems to have chosen
them as the principal material of his history. He simply
suggests that miracles were wrought by the rest, but records
particularly what Peter did for the establishment of
the faith. He relates but very little of those who became
Christians by the exertion of others, but notes at large the
abundant fruit of Peter's teaching. Take an ancient
author's summary of the Acts, "this whole volume is about
the ascension of Christ after the resurrection, and about the
descent of the Holy Spirit on the holy Apostles, and how
and where the disciples announced Christ's religion, and all
the wondrous deeds which they did by prayer and faith in
Him, and about Paul's divine calling from heaven, his apostleship,
and fruitful preaching, and in a word about those
many great dangers which the Apostles underwent for
Christ:"<a name="FNanchor_13_216" id="FNanchor_13_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_216" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> follow, out of this, all which concerns the universal
Church in the first twelve chapters, and Peter will be
found not only the principal, but well nigh the only, figure
in the foreground.</p>

<p>6. Hence as the Gospels may be called the history of
Christ, so this first part of the Acts may be called the history
of Peter; for as Christ occupies each page of the Gospels,
so Peter here. Nothing can be more emphatic or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>more just than S. Chrysostome's words: "Behold him
making his rounds on every side, and the first to be found;
when an Apostle was to be chosen, he was the first; when
the Jews were to be told that they were not drunken;
when the lame man was to be healed; when the multitude
was to be addressed, he is before the rest; when they had
to do with the rulers, it is he; when with Ananias, when
healings took place from the shadow, still it is he. Where
there was danger, it is he, and where there was dispensation;
but when all is tranquil, they act in common. He
sought not the greater honour. But again, when miracles
are to be worked, he comes forth before the rest."<a name="FNanchor_14_217" id="FNanchor_14_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_217" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> What
can prove Peter's pre-eminence if this does not? But his
words on another occasion deserve mention. Alluding to
the title "Acts of the Apostles," which seems to promise
their common history, he observes, "Yet if you search
accurately, the first part of the book exhibits Peter's miracles
and teaching, but little on the part of the other Apostles;
and after this the whole account is spent on Paul."
But he adds, "How are they the acts of all the Apostles?
Because, according to Paul, when one member is glorified,
all the members are glorified with it, the historian did not
entitle them, the Acts of Peter and of Paul, but the Acts
of the Apostles; the promise of the writer includes them
all."<a name="FNanchor_15_218" id="FNanchor_15_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_218" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Now every one must feel the very high distinction
given to Paul in the latter part of the book, when the historian
turns away from the general history of the Church
to record his particular labours, in which, no doubt, the
object was to show the progress of the Church among the
Gentiles; but with regard to the part which is common to
the whole Church, another thought is suggested. The history
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>of what Peter taught and did, to build up and extend
the Church, is considered the common history of the Apostles,
and so inscribed as their Acts. But can this be called
an <i>accurate</i> expression, unless Peter had been the head of
the Apostles? It is very plain that the acts of a head are
imputed to the whole body; to a college of brethren, what
its chief executes; to a city or kingdom, the deeds of its
prince. But it is not plain how this can be, if the actor be
one of a number, and do not exceed his brethren in honour
or dignity. Therefore the Acts of Peter could be called,
generally, the Acts of the Apostles, only because they were
considered the Acts of their head.</p>

<p>Now let us pass from the general view to that in detail.</p>

<p>I. After <a name="FNanchor_16_219" id="FNanchor_16_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_219" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>the Lord's ascension a most important point
immediately arose, whether, that is, the number of the
Twelve was to be filled up by the election of a new Apostle
to take the place of Judas. The will of Christ on this
matter was to be learnt; a witness was to be chosen who
should participate in the mission of Christ Himself, according
to the words, "As the Father hath sent Me, I also send
you," and carry the light of the Gospel to the ends of the
world; and one was to be elected to the dignity of the
Apostolate, the highest rank in the Church. It was, therefore,
so important a matter, that no one could undertake it
save he who had received the vicarious headship of our
Lord Himself. Now the history in the Acts tells us that
Peter alone spoke on the subject of substituting a fresh
Apostle for Judas; Peter alone proved from Scripture the
necessity of the election, defined the conditions of eligibility,
and appointed the mode of election, and presided
over and directed the whole transaction.</p>

<p>For Luke begins thus: "In those days," the interval
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>between the Ascension and Pentecost, "Peter rising up in
the midst of the brethren, said." Here the important
prerogative <i>of initiation</i> is shown to belong to Peter, and
by the phrase, "in the midst of the brethren," or "disciples,"&mdash;which
is often used of Christ in respect of the
Apostles&mdash;his pre-eminence over the disciples is shown.
"Brethren, it behoved that the Scripture should be fulfilled
which the Holy Ghost spoke before by the mouth
of David, concerning Judas, who was the leader of them
that apprehended Jesus, who was numbered with us, and
had obtained part of this ministry," that is, of the Apostolate.
Then having mentioned the miserable end of the
traitor, he applies to him the prophecy: "For it is written
in the Book of Psalms, 'Let his habitation become desolate,
and let there be none to dwell therein:' and, adding
another prophecy from another Psalm, 'his bishopric let
another take.'"<a name="FNanchor_17_220" id="FNanchor_17_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_220" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Whence he concludes, "Wherefore of
these men who have companied with us all the time
that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us,
beginning from the baptism of John, until the day wherein
He was taken up from us, one of these <i>must</i> be made a
witness with us of His resurrection." In these words
Peter plainly points out the <i>necessity</i> of the matter in
question, confirms it by the Holy Scriptures, speaking in
the character of their highest interpreter, and as the
appointed teacher of all; and, while proposing it to their
deliberation, yet requires their consent; for the phrase,
"wherefore, one <i>must</i>," means, "I am not proposing what
may be done or left undone, but declaring and prescribing
what is to be done." So he determines the conditions of
eligibility, and the form of election. Whereupon his
hearers&mdash;"the number of persons together about an hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>and twenty"&mdash;instantly agree unanimously to Peter's
proposition, follow its conditions, and complete the election.</p>

<p>No one can reflect on the above without concluding,
that if Peter presided over the rest by the authority of
a divinely chosen headship, no course could be more
becoming, both for Peter and for the disciples, than this;
and if, on the contrary, Peter was only one out of many,
not having yet even received the Pentecostal gifts of the
Holy Spirit, and had been entrusted by Christ with no
pre-eminent office in the ministry, nothing could be more
unfitting for both. We have therefore to infer that Peter
"stood in the midst of the disciples," as a superior among
inferiors, not as an equal among equals, and conceived
that the charge of supplying an Apostle, and filling up
the Apostolic college, belonged in chief to himself, because
he and they alike were conscious, that he was the steward
set in chief over the Lord's family.</p>

<p>But, clear as this is on the face of the narration itself,
fresh light is shed on it by the fact that S. Chrysostome
observed and recorded this very conclusion. For why did
Peter alone arise? Why was he the first and the only
one to speak? "Both<a name="FNanchor_18_221" id="FNanchor_18_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_221" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> as fervent, and <i>as one entrusted by
Christ with the flock</i>, and <i>as the first of the choir</i>, he
ever first begins to speak." Why does he allege prophecy?
First, that he might not seem with human counsel "to
attempt a great matter, and one fitted for Christ:" next
to imitate his Master, "he always reasons from the Scriptures."
"Why did he not singly ask of Christ to give
him some one in the place of Judas?" Because "Peter
had now improved," and overcome his natural disposition.
But "<i>might not Peter by himself have elected?</i> Certainly:
but he does not so, that he may not seem partial." "Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>does he communicate this to them," the whole number of
the names? "That the matter may not be contested,
nor they fall into strife: for" (he alludes to the contention
of the Apostles for the primacy,) "if this had happened to
themselves, much more would it to the others," that is,
the candidates to succeed Judas. Then he points out to
our admiration "Peter doing this with common consent,
nothing<a name="FNanchor_19_222" id="FNanchor_19_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_222" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> with authority, nothing with lordship," where we
must note that the <i>abuse</i> of a power is only to be feared
from one who really has that power. For again he
says, "he first acts with<a name="FNanchor_20_223" id="FNanchor_20_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_223" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> authority in the matter, <i>as
having himself all put into his hands</i>, for to him Christ
said, 'And thou in thy turn one day confirm thy
brethren.'"</p>

<p>The college of the Apostles completed, it followed that the
head, if such there were, would on every occasion of danger,
be the first to protect it, and to defend its reputation.
Now there ensues the miracle of the Holy Spirit's descent,
and the gift of tongues, whereupon Luke describes the
various opinions of the astonished multitude, some of whom
"mocking,<a name="FNanchor_21_224" id="FNanchor_21_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_224" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> said, These men are full of new wine." That
is, they blasphemed the working of the Spirit, and by the
most monstrous calumny were destroying the good name
of the Apostles. Whereupon, "Peter, standing up with
the Eleven, lifted up his voice and spoke to them: Ye men
of Judea, and all you that dwell in Jerusalem, be this
known to you, and with your ears receive my words. For
these are not drunk as you suppose, seeing it is but the
third hour of the day: but this is that which was spoken of
by the prophet Joel." Now here, both the <i>form of the
words</i>, and the <i>matter</i>, establish Peter's primacy. For
the phrase, "Peter standing up with the Eleven, lifted up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>his voice and spoke to them," portrays Peter as the leader
of the band, the master of the family. So S. Chrysostome,<a name="FNanchor_22_225" id="FNanchor_22_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_225" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
"What means <i>with the Eleven</i>? They uttered a
common voice, and he was the mouthpiece of all. And the
Eleven stand beside him, bearing witness to his words."
And as to the <i>matter</i>, Peter alone fulfils the part of teacher,
by interpreting scripture, and declaring the agreement of
both covenants: Peter alone maintains the common cause:
Peter alone, representing all, addresses the multitude in the
name of all. "Observe, too, the harmony of the Apostles:
they give up to him the office of speaking:"<a name="FNanchor_23_226" id="FNanchor_23_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_226" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> that is,
they yielded to him who was the Head, and who, as he
says, showed here "the courage," as before "the providential
care" of the Head.</p>

<p>After refuting the calumny, Peter goes on in a noble
discourse to explain prophecies, and then coming to the dispensation
of Jesus, gives the strongest proofs of His resurrection
and exaltation to the right hand of the Father,
and finally sums up with great force and authority.
"Therefore, let all the house of Israel know most certainly,
that God hath made both Lord and Christ this same Jesus
whom you have crucified."</p>

<p>Now, what<a name="FNanchor_24_227" id="FNanchor_24_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_227" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> is here to our purpose? It is this, that
Luke seems only to dwell on what concerns Peter: that
Peter, first of all, and in the name of all, performs the
office of a witness, laid both on himself and the rest, ("ye
shall be witnesses to Me;" "and you shall give witness,")<a name="FNanchor_25_228" id="FNanchor_25_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_228" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
saying, "this Jesus hath God raised up, of which we all
are witnesses:" that first of all, he publicly and solemnly
discharges the duty of instruction with authority: that,
first of all, he fulfils the charge set by Christ on all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Apostles, "make disciples&mdash;teach:" that, first of all, he promulgates
the necessity of believing in Jesus as the divinely
appointed Lord and Christ. Now these are things which,
so far from allowing an equality between Peter and the
rest of the Apostles, point out in him a headship over
them.</p>

<p>Thereupon, the hearers, struck with compunction for
having crucified, not merely a just man, but the Anointed
of the Lord, "said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles"&mdash;here
again he alone is singly named&mdash;but of all alike they
asked, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Whereupon,
S. Chrysostome<a name="FNanchor_26_229" id="FNanchor_26_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_229" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> notes, "here again, where all are
asked, he alone replies." For, as Luke goes on, "Peter
said to them:" As the leader, he performs what belongs to
all: he alone sets forth the law of Christ. "Do penance,
and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jesus
Christ, for the remission of sins:" he alone encourages them
with the promised gifts of the Holy Spirit, "and you shall
receive the gift of the Holy Ghost:" he alone continues at
length the instruction of the hearers, "and with very many
other words did he testify and exhort them:" he alone
declares the fruit of Christian profession, "save yourselves
from this perverse generation," and he alone it is, of whose
ministry Luke adds, "They, therefore, that gladly received
his word were baptized, and there were added, in that
day, about three thousand souls."</p>

<p>And here we see how fitting it was that Peter, whom
Christ had set as the foundation and rock of the Church,
should labour with all his might, as the chief architect after
Him, to build up the structure. But what, in the meantime,
of the other Apostles? Were not they also architects?
Yes, but <i>with</i> Peter, and <i>under</i> Peter, whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>accordingly, they attend and support. The subsequent
additions to the Church's structure, and the course consistently
pursued by Peter, will bring this out yet more
clearly. For, of fresh accretions, Luke writes, "Many of
them who had heard the word, believed, and the number of
the men was made five thousand."<a name="FNanchor_27_230" id="FNanchor_27_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_230" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>  Now, whose word
was this? Still the word of Peter, who speaks for the
third<a name="FNanchor_28_231" id="FNanchor_28_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_231" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> and fourth time, as he had for the first and
second.</p>

<p>For, as to the third<a name="FNanchor_29_232" id="FNanchor_29_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_232" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> occasion, Luke, after mentioning
Peter and John together, introduces Peter alone as urging
the children of Abraham to embrace the faith of Christ,
and persuading them that Jesus is the Prophet, promised
by God through Moses in Deuteronomy. And as to the
fourth,<a name="FNanchor_30_233" id="FNanchor_30_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_233" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> he writes, "Then Peter, filled with the Holy
Ghost, said to them&mdash;" But was he alone present? not
so, for the council "setting them," not him, but John as
well as Peter, "in the midst, they asked," on which
Chrysostome<a name="FNanchor_31_234" id="FNanchor_31_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_234" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> observes, "See how John is on every occasion
silent, while Peter defends him likewise." That is,
John was silent, as knowing that the lead belonged to
Peter, and Peter spoke, because the Head defends not
himself only, but the members committed to him.</p>

<p>Now, reviewing these first four chapters of the Acts, let
us ask these questions. Had Peter held the authority of
head among the Apostles, what would he have done? He
would have filled up the Apostolic college, carefully watched
over it, protected its several members. But this is just
what he did. Again, had Christ made him the supreme
teacher and doctor, what would he have done? He
would have disclosed, first to the Apostles themselves, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>to the disciples, and then to the multitude, who were to be
converted, the secrets of the divine will laid up in the
Scriptures; he would have shown the agreement between
the dispensation of Christ, and the oracles of the Old
Testament, and so have proved that Jesus was the
Messiah. But this he repeatedly did. Once more, had
Christ made him the chief among the builders of the
Church, what would have been his office? He would have
been the very first to set his hand to the work, and to
construct the building with living stones; he would have
held the other workmen under his control, so that the
edifice might rise worthy of Christ, and exactly answering
to His promises. But does not the history give precisely
this picture of him, and does not the Church which
Peter raised answer exactly to the archetype prescribed
by the Lord? "All they that believed were together, and
had all things common:" "the multitude of believers had
but one heart and one soul:" what is this but the counterpart
of that divine prayer, "that they all may be one, as
Thou, Father, art in Me, and I in Thee, that they also may
be one in Us, that the world may believe that Thou hast
sent<a name="FNanchor_32_235" id="FNanchor_32_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_235" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Me."</p>

<p>II. To take another point. The office of<a name="FNanchor_33_236" id="FNanchor_33_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_236" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> authoritative
teaching is in the New Testament closely connected with
the power of working miracles, so that Christ not only said
of Himself, "If I had not come and spoken to them, they
would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for
their sin:" but likewise added, "If I had not done among
them the works that no other man hath done, they would
not have sin: but now they have both seen and hated both
Me and My Father:"<a name="FNanchor_34_237" id="FNanchor_34_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_237" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> to shew that, while faith depended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>on preaching, and authoritative instruction, these also
needed the power of <i>works</i> to conciliate conviction. In
accordance with which, when He first sent out His Twelve
to preach, He not only charged them what to say, "the
kingdom of heaven is at hand,"<a name="FNanchor_35_238" id="FNanchor_35_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_238" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> but added the fullest
miraculous power, "heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse
the lepers, cast out devils." And when more solemnly
sending them, not to one people, but to all nations, "Go
ye into the whole world, and preach the Gospel to every
creature," He adds their warrant, "these signs shall follow
them that believe. In My name they shall cast out devils,
they shall speak with new tongues, they shall take up serpents:"
and the Evangelist subjoins, "They going forth
preached everywhere, the Lord working withal, and confirming
the word with signs that followed."<a name="FNanchor_36_239" id="FNanchor_36_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_239" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Remembering, then, this very close connexion between
the authority of Apostolic teaching and the power of working
miracles, we may fix a criterion for recognising the
exercise of the supreme office in teaching. Suppose any
one of the Apostles to have been invested at the commencement
of the Church with this office, how may he be ascertained?
If any one is found invariably the first to announce
the word of truth, and likewise to confirm it with
miracles, you may suppose him to be that one. Suppose,
again, that Luke intended to represent one of the Apostles
as the supreme teacher. How may it be safely inferred?
If, in the course of his narration, he continually exhibits
one as eminent above all the rest in preaching the Gospel
and guaranteeing it by signs. These are not tests arbitrarily
chosen, but naturally suggested. And both exactly fit
to Peter, and to Peter alone. For he, in this history of
the universal Church, is the first, nay, well nigh the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>one, both to preach and to support his preaching by miracles.
And Luke takes pains to relate no less his miracles
than his discourses, and scarcely describes with any detail
either the one or the other, of any but Peter.</p>

<p>Nay, his mode of writing suggests a parallel between
himself and S. John in his Gospel, as if it were no less
Luke's intention to show Peter invested with the supreme
office, than John's to set forth Christ as the head and
teacher of the Apostolic college; and no less Luke's purpose
to accredit the Church by Peter's miracles, than<a name="FNanchor_37_240" id="FNanchor_37_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_240" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
John's by the miracles of Christ to establish faith in Him
as the true Son of God. For the circumstances of each
narration point to this similarity of design. As S. John
subordinates the group of Apostles entirely to the figure of
Christ, so Luke, very slightly sketching the rest, is profuse
in detail of what concerns Peter, and marks him as set over
all. As John in recording the miracles of Christ dwells
on the points which prove His divine mission and origin
from the Father, so Luke directs his narration to exhibit
the beginning, the growth, and the authority of the
Church, as due to Peter's miracles. We will mark two
further resemblances. <i>First</i>, the miracles which Luke
records of Peter seem cast in the same type as those of
Christ. Compare the first one with that told by John,
ch. v.</p>

<blockquote><p>John v. 5-9. "There was
a certain man there that had
been eight and thirty years
under his infirmity. Him
when Jesus had seen lying,
and knew that he had been
now a long time, He saith
to him, Wilt thou be made
whole? The infirm man
answered Him, Sir, I have
no man, when the water is
troubled, to put me into the
pond. For whilst I am coming
another goeth down before
me. Jesus said to him,
Arise, take up thy bed, and
walk. And immediately the
man was made whole, and he
took up his bed and walked."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Acts iii. 2-8. "And a certain
man, who was lame from
his mother's womb, was carried,
whom they laid every
day at the gate of the temple,
which is called Beautiful.
He, when he had seen
Peter and John about to go
into the temple, asked to receive
an alms. But Peter,
with John, fastening his eyes
upon him, said, Look upon
us. But he looked earnestly
upon them, hoping that he
should receive something of
them. But Peter said, Silver
and gold I have none,
but what I have, I give thee.
In the name of Jesus Christ
of Nazareth, arise and walk.
And taking him by the right
hand, he lifted him up, and
forthwith his feet and soles received
strength, and he, leaping
up, stood, and walked."</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>How often had the hand of the Lord&mdash;as here that of
Peter&mdash;healed the sick, given the blind sight, cured the
leper, and raised the dead! But if Peter's miracle in healing
&OElig;neas of the palsy carries<a name="FNanchor_38_241" id="FNanchor_38_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_241" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> one back immediately to
the poor man let down through the roof before our Lord,
there is a yet more exact identity between the great miracle
of Christ raising Jairus' daughter, and Peter raising Dorcas.
In the one case, the Lord "having put them all out, taketh
the father and the mother of the damsel, and them that were
with Him, and entereth in where the damsel was lying, and
taking the damsel by the hand, He said to her, Talitha
cumi, which is, Damsel, arise, and immediately the damsel
rose up and walked." In the other case, Peter came into
the upper chamber, "and all the widows stood about him
weeping&mdash;and they being all put forth, Peter, kneeling
down, prayed, and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha,
arise. And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter,
she sat up,<a name="FNanchor_39_242" id="FNanchor_39_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_242" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and giving her his hand he lifted her up."
But how perfect the resemblance of the following.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Luke iv. 40. "And when
the sun was down, all they
that had any sick with divers
diseases brought them
to Him. But He, laying His
hands on every one of them,
healed them. And devils
went out from many."</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Acts v. 15. "Insomuch that
they brought forth the sick
into the streets, and laid
them on beds and couches,
that, when Peter came, his
shadow, at the least, might
overshadow any of them, and
they might be delivered from
their infirmities. And there
came also together to Jerusalem
a multitude out of the
neighbouring cities, bringing
sick persons, and such as
were troubled with unclean
spirits, who were all healed."</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>second</i> point of resemblance is, that the multitude
regarded Peter among the Apostles as before they had
regarded Christ: for, putting the rest of the Apostles in the
second place, they flocked to him, and besought his aid.
So that Luke, briefly saying of them, that "by the hands
of the Apostles were many signs and wonders wrought
among the people,"<a name="FNanchor_40_243" id="FNanchor_40_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_243" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> goes on to Peter, and of him relates
the unheard-of wonders just described, assigning to the
miracles wrought by him, "that the multitude of men and
women who believed in the Lord was more increased." It
is just as when "there came to Jesus great multitudes,
having with them the dumb, the blind, the lame, the
maimed, and many others; and they cast them down at
His feet, and He healed them."<a name="FNanchor_41_244" id="FNanchor_41_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_244" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> And the fuller the
resemblance these incidents shew between Peter and Christ,
the more evident their proof that Peter's ministry must be
considered a continuation of that which Christ begun.</p>

<p>III. We proceed<a name="FNanchor_42_245" id="FNanchor_42_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_245" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> to the order predetermined by our
Lord in the propagation of His Church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p><p>Of Himself He had said, though the Redeemer of all,
that He was not sent, that is, as an Apostle, actually to
preach, "save to the lost sheep of the house of Israel:" and
on first sending His Apostles, He gave them this commission,
"Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles, and into the
city of the Samaritans enter ye not, but go ye rather to the
lost sheep of the house of Israel." But when about to
ascend to the Father, He tells them, "You shall receive the
power of the Holy Ghost coming upon you, and you shall
be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and
Samaria, and even to the uttermost part of the earth:"<a name="FNanchor_43_246" id="FNanchor_43_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_246" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
that is, that they should set up His kingdom through all
the world, proceeding by gradual steps, from Jerusalem to
Judea, thence to Samaria, and at length "to every creature"
in the whole world.</p>

<p>Now the history of the Acts shows the exact accomplishment
of this order, and it likewise shows that Simon Peter
was the one elected chief instrument for carrying out these
successive propagations of the Church. What we have
said already shows this as to the mother Church of Jerusalem,
and, before proceeding to the Gentile Churches,
we will trace the same instrumentality as used to bring
the Samaritans into the universal kingdom.</p>

<p>The persecution ensuing on the proto-martyr Stephen's
death caused, by our Lord's providence, the dissemination
of many believers through Judea and Samaria, while the
Apostles alone remained at Jerusalem. Amongst those
who thus "went about preaching the word of God,"
Philip the deacon came to Samaria, and many of the
people, hearing his words and seeing his miracles, were
converted and baptized. But the Church thus commenced
by the preaching of the deacon would have dried up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>without hope of progress, had it not received the assistance
of those whom Christ had set in the place of
fathers, and who could bestow the gifts of the Holy
Ghost. For<a name="FNanchor_44_247" id="FNanchor_44_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_247" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> "the Church is in the bishop," and, as S.
Jerome said of a faction which had a deacon for its
author, "With the man the sect also perished, because
a deacon could ordain no clerk after him. But it is not
a Church which has no priest." Accordingly when<a name="FNanchor_45_248" id="FNanchor_45_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_248" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
"the Apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that
Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto
them Peter and John," who "laid their hands upon them,
and they received the Holy Ghost." The providence of
Christ, then, so ordered the propagation of His kingdom
as to choose Peter and John to complete and perfect the
Samaritan Church. But was this on equal terms, or is
no superior dignity and authority apparent in Peter over
John? A regard to the words of Luke, and the series
of acts recorded, will prevent such a misconception. For
he mentions Peter and John, but he sets Peter first, and
in his record of what happened to Simon John acts the
second part, and it is Peter alone who teaches, commands,
judges, and condemns, with authority, as the head and
supreme ruler. Simon Magus, tempted by beholding the
gifts of the Holy Spirit visibly bestowed on imposition
of the Apostles' hands, "offered them money," to both
Peter and John. But Peter alone replies, and not only
so, but condemns his profaneness, enlarges on his guilt,
and solemnly declares that the gifts of God are not purchaseable
with money. "Keep thy money to thyself to
perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift
of God may be purchased with money;" he discloses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>Simon's secret thoughts, "for thy heart is not right in
the sight of God;" he inflicts on him excommunication,
"thou hast no part nor lot in this matter;" he exhorts
him to repent, "do penance therefore from this thy wickedness,
and pray to God, if perhaps this thought of thy
heart may be forgiven thee." Now here John, the next
of the Apostles in rank, is with Peter, yet he does not
speak, teach, or enjoin: Peter does all this singly. He
answers Simon's question, lances and probes the most
secret wound of his conscience, declares how divine gifts
are given, proscribes the plague of simony, orders penance,
and inflicts excommunication on a scandalous public offender.
Thus the twenty-second of the Apostolic canons runs,
"If any bishop, priest or deacon, hath obtained this dignity
by money, let him and his ordainer be deposed, and
altogether be deprived of communion, as Simon Magus
was by Peter." Nothing but an inequality of rank between
Peter and John will account for Luke's narration here.
But if John was inferior to Peter, much more the rest.</p>

<p>But there is another proof of his superiority here, in
that God caused Simon Peter to engage Simon Magus.
Thus, by His providence, "reaching from end to end
mightily, and ordering all things sweetly," the first-born
of Christ is brought to conflict with the "first-born of the
devil," the chief of teachers with the earliest of heretics,
and prime of that long brood of the evil one, who are to
persecute "the seed of the woman." Thus ancient writers
record that Peter afterwards went to Rome on purpose to
expose the acts of this same Simon. Thus they mention
his engaging with the famous Alexandrine Apion, the
enemy of the Jewish and the Christian faith alike. And
hence, too, probably the very ancient writer (whoever he
was) of the Epistle of Clement to S. James, begins it by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
recording how "Simon, for his true faith and his firm
grounding in doctrine, was appointed to be the foundation
of the Church, and for this very reason by Jesus
Himself with most true augury had his name changed to
Peter, the first-fruits of our Lord, the first of the Apostles,
to whom first the Father revealed the Son, whom
Christ with reason blessed, the called and the elect, His
guest and comrade, the good and the proved disciple,
<i>he who, as the most able of all, was commanded to
illuminate the West, the darker quarter of the world</i>,
and who was enabled to succeed."</p>

<p>But as to what is said that "the Apostles who were
in Jerusalem <i>sent</i> to the Samaritans Peter and John," it
must be remembered, that at the head of those thus <i>sending</i>
was Peter himself, and that next to him John was the
most distinguished of the Apostolic college. And since it is
evident from all that we have hitherto seen, that in whatever
concerned the Apostles equally, Peter took the leading
part, and in their common deliberations exercised the
initiative, it must be concluded that he was likewise the
first author of this resolution, to send himself and John
to the Samaritans. And this is confirmed by our seeing
that in the fulfilment of this mission he discharges the
offices, and acts with the authority, of head. To none
else could the execution of a fresh advance in the propagation
of the Church be committed; and so great, besides,
were the jealousies between the Jews and Samaritans, that
it needed no less than Peter's authority to induce the
Jewish converts to receive them into the bond of the same
society.</p>

<p>IV. But now we<a name="FNanchor_46_249" id="FNanchor_46_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_249" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> draw nigh to the revelation of that
great "mystery which in other generations was not known
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>to the sons of men&mdash;that the Gentiles should be fellow
heirs, and of the same body, and co-partners of His promise
in Christ Jesus by the Gospel," whereby was brought
to pass the prophecy, "from the rising of the sun even to
the going down My Name is great among the Gentiles, and
in every place there is sacrifice, and there is offered to My
Name a clean oblation."<a name="FNanchor_47_250" id="FNanchor_47_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_250" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The hour was come "when the
true adorers were to adore the Father in spirit and in
truth" throughout every region of the world purchased
with the blood of the Son of God, and of this event, expected
during four thousand years, God, by an unexampled
honour, disclosed to Peter, and through Peter, the time and
the manner. This greatest of purposes, after His own
ascension, Christ left to be revealed through him to whom
He had committed the feeding of His sheep.</p>

<p>While Peter<a name="FNanchor_48_251" id="FNanchor_48_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_251" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> was "passing through all," that is, exercising
his general supervision as primate of the Church,
God sent His angel "in a vision manifestly" to "a certain
man in Cesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of that which
is called the Italian band, a religious man, and fearing God
with all his house, giving much alms to the people, and
always praying to God." And the angel says to him:
"Thy prayers and thine alms are ascended for a memorial
in the sight of God, and now send men to Joppa, and call
hither one Simon, who is surnamed Peter; he will tell thee
what thou must do." Though God, then, sends an angel,
it is left to <i>Simon, who is surnamed Peter</i>, to declare His
counsel, in what affected the salvation of innumerable souls.
Other Apostles there were to whom had been said equally,
"Go ye into the whole world and preach the Gospel to
every creature," and "Ye shall be witnesses to Me both in
Jerusalem and in all Judea, and Samaria, and to the uttermost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>part of the earth;" and "as the Father hath sent Me,
I also send you." Yet putting aside all these, as on so
many other occasions, Peter is preferred, and that because
to him alone was said, "on this rock I will build My
Church," and again, "Feed My lambs, be shepherd over
My sheep." Fitting it was that, when the wall between
the Jews and Gentiles should be taken away, by him specially,
all should be collected into one, on whom, as the
divinely-laid foundation, all were to rest. Fitting, again,
that the Lord's prophecy, "Other sheep I have which are
not of this fold; those also I must bring; and they shall
hear My voice; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd,"
should be fulfilled chiefly by his ministry to whom
the Lord had committed His own office of universal visible
pastor. For the Church, in her very birth, and in the
whole process of her growth, bore this upon her forehead,
that <i>universality</i> as well as <i>unity</i> belonged substantially to
Peter, and that it was no less his function to gather up all
nations into the mould of unity by his ministration as the
one chief shepherd, than to embrace them all in the wide
circuit of his love. Therefore it is a marvellous agreement
in which the <i>institution</i> of the Primacy has a corresponding
<i>execution</i>; and as the latter confirms the former, so from
the former you might anticipate the latter before it was
recorded in the sacred history.</p>

<p>But in the meantime, while the messengers of Cornelius
were approaching the house in which Peter was a guest,
"there came upon him an ecstasy of mind, and he saw the
heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, as it were
a great linen sheet let down by the four corners from heaven
to the earth, wherein were all manner of four-footed
beasts, and creeping things of the earth, and fowls of the
air;" and while Peter is fixed in contemplation, "there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
came a voice to him, Arise Peter, kill and eat," that he
might understand how "by<a name="FNanchor_49_252" id="FNanchor_49_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_252" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> his preaching he was to
make a sacrifice to the Lord of those who were represented
by these animals, bringing them into the divine service
through the mysteries of the Lord's passion," which he
not yet understanding, replies, "Far be it from me, for I
never did eat anything that is common or unclean." Then
the heavenly "voice spoke to him again the second time,
That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call common.
And this having been done thrice, presently the vessel was
taken up into heaven."</p>

<p>Here three things are set forth; first, that as the ark of
Noah contained all sorts of animals, clean and unclean, so
the fold of Christ was to gather from Jews and Greeks
and barbarians "a<a name="FNanchor_50_253" id="FNanchor_50_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_253" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> great multitude, which no man could
number, of all nations and tribes, and peoples, and
tongues;" secondly, that the blessings of Christ concerned
all who did not reject the proferred grace; thirdly, that
the elaborate system of Mosaic ordinances concerning
meats, rites, and ceremonies, had fallen to the ground.
But to whom is disclosed, first and immediately, this whole
dispensation of the first principles on which the Church
was to be propagated? To none other but Peter, "to me
hath God shown to call no man common or unclean." Now
the undoubted knowledge of this dispensation must appear
of the greatest moment, whether in itself, or as concerns
the Jews, of whom the earliest church consisted, or the
Apostles, by whose ministry it was to be extended. And
yet, by that providence which is ever over His Church, the
wisdom of God so ruled it, that through Peter alone the
Apostles should be taught when they were first to approach
the Gentiles, and discharge their office of witnesses before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>all nations without distinction. And that because He had
made Peter "the greater one" and "the leader" of all,
and put him in His own place, and constituted him supreme
teacher in these words, "Confirm thy brethren." Thus<a name="FNanchor_51_254" id="FNanchor_51_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_254" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Epiphanius, in the fourth century, says that the charge
of bringing the Gentiles into the Church was laid upon
all the Apostles, "but most of all on holy Peter." Why
this <i>most of all</i>? Because, while He had heard with the
rest, "make disciples of all nations," he had singly and
peculiarly received the charge of the whole fold, and of the
Apostles, as part of it.</p>

<p>But Peter, still pondering on the vision, hears a fresh
voice from the Spirit, "Behold three men seek thee.
Arise, therefore, get thee down, and go with them, doubting
nothing, for I have sent them." He accompanies the
messengers and finds Cornelius, "his kinsman and his special
friends;" he asks why they have sent for him, whereupon
Cornelius informs him of what had past, and concludes,
"now therefore all we are present in thy sight, to
hear all things whatsoever are commanded thee by the
Lord." Peter in reply sets forth to them the heads of
Christian doctrine, and as he comes to the words "to Him
all the prophets give testimony, that by His name all receive
remission of sins, who believe in Him," "the Holy
Ghost fell upon all them that heard the word" of life and
truth from his lips. And the Jewish Christians who were
with him, being astonished at this reception of Gentiles
into the Church by the Holy Spirit's visible descent, Peter
cries, "Can any man forbid water that these should not be
baptised, who have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?"
"Words," says <a name="FNanchor_52_255" id="FNanchor_52_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_255" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>S. Chrysostome, "of one almost assaulting
any that would forbid, and say that should not be," and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>so "he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the
Lord Jesus;" for Peter also, like his Lord,<a name="FNanchor_53_256" id="FNanchor_53_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_256" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> preached in
person, but baptized by the hands of others.</p>

<p>Are not then the prerogatives of Peter written legibly
on this whole narration? First, among all the Apostles
he alone is chosen to consecrate to God the first fruits of
the Gentiles. Again, through him, as the teacher of all,
God makes known to the Apostles themselves when the
door was to be opened to the Gentiles. Thirdly, without
advising with the rest, he enlarges the fold of Christ,
which in Christ's place he ruled, with the accession of
the Gentiles. Fourthly, the building of the Church is
thus referred to him alone. Further, he gathers up to
himself the Church which is made out of Jews, Samaritans,
and Gentiles; as the foundation he sustains the
whole; and when constructed, he binds it together. Lastly,
Luke, without having recorded a single speech of any
other Apostle, has given five of Peter, thus showing that
Peter's words, as well as his actions, had a higher importance
than theirs in the history of the Church's birth and
growth; for, indeed, in the history of the head that of the
body is included.</p>

<p>On Peter's<a name="FNanchor_54_257" id="FNanchor_54_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_257" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> return to Jerusalem, "the Apostles and
brethren who were in Judea, having heard that the Gentiles
also had received the word of God,"<a name="FNanchor_55_258" id="FNanchor_55_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_258" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> "they that
were of the circumcision contended with him," because he
had "gone in to men uncircumcised, and ate with them."
Hereupon Peter set forth to them the whole series of
events, upon which "they held their peace and glorified
God, saying, God then has also to the Gentiles given
repentance unto life." Now some in late times have
attempted to derogate from Peter's authority on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>strength of this incident. On the other hand S. Chrysostome,
not satisfied with setting forth Peter's rank, and
assigning his whole apology to a most gracious condescension,
continues, "See how he defends himself, and
<i>will not use his dignity as the Teacher</i>, for he knew that
the more gently he spoke with them, the surer he was
to win them."<a name="FNanchor_56_259" id="FNanchor_56_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_259" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> And what expression can signify Peter's
rank more markedly than <i>the</i> Teacher? And Gregory
the Great sets forth Peter's distinctions, how he alone
had received the keys, walked on the waters, healed with
his shadow, killed with his word, and raised the dead
by his prayer; then he goes on, "and because, warned
by the Spirit, he had gone in to Cornelius, a Gentile, a
question was raised against him by the faithful, as to
wherefore he had gone in to the Gentiles, and eaten with
them, and received them in baptism. And yet the same
first of the Apostles, filled with so great a grace of gifts,
supported by so great a power of miracles, answers the
complaint of the faithful by an appeal not to authority
but to reason.... For if, when blamed by the faithful,
he had considered the authority which he held in
holy Church, he might have answered, that the sheep
entrusted to the shepherd should not venture to censure
him. But if, in the complaint of the faithful, he had said
anything of his own power, he would not have been the
teacher of meekness. Therefore he quieted them with
humble reason, and in the matter where he was blamed
even cited witnesses. If, therefore, <i>the Pastor of the
Church, the Prince of the Apostles</i>, having a <i>singular</i>
power to do signs and miracles, did not disdain, when he
was censured, humbly to render account, how much more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>ought we sinners, when blamed for anything, to disarm
our censurers by a humble defence."<a name="FNanchor_57_260" id="FNanchor_57_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_260" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>Here it occurs to observe with what different eyes Holy
Scripture may be read, for just where persons determined
to deny Peter's authority find an excuse for their foregone
conclusion, the Fathers draw arguments to praise the
moderation with which he exercised that same superior
authority.</p>

<p>V. But <a name="FNanchor_58_261" id="FNanchor_58_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_261" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>founded as we have seen the Church to have
hitherto been, and at each step of its course advanced,
mainly by the authority of Peter, it could not hope to
remain in a vigorous and united state without the continual
exercise of <i>judicial</i> and <i>legislative</i> power, and diligent
<i>inspection</i>. Nor is there, in fact, one of these which
Peter did not exercise, and that in a manner to indicate
the ruler set over all. For as to the judicial power, do we
not hear him saying, "Tell<a name="FNanchor_59_262" id="FNanchor_59_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_262" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> me whether you sold the land
for so much;" and, "Ananias, why hath Satan tempted
thy heart, that thou shouldst lie to the Holy Ghost, and
by fraud keep part of the price of the land? Whilst it
remained did it not remain to thee? And after it was
sold, was it not in thy power? Why hast thou conceived
this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied to men but
to God." And presently the sentence comes forth from
him who binds in heaven as well as on earth. "Behold
the feet of them who have buried thy husband are at the
door, and they shall carry thee out." Here then we have
Peter, in the midst of the Apostles, yet acting singly as
the supreme judge, and defender of ecclesiastical discipline,
on which S. Chrysostome says, "For Peter was terrible,
punishing, and convicting the thoughts, to whom
they adhered the more both for the sign, and his first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>speech, and his second, and his third. For he it was who
did the first sign, and the second, and the present, which
seems to me double, one to convict the thoughts, and
another to kill with his command." Then, asking why
nobody had announced her husband's death to Sapphira,
"This was fear of the Teacher; this respect of the disciples;
this obedience:"<a name="FNanchor_60_263" id="FNanchor_60_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_263" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> where he is mentioned not as
<i>a</i> teacher, but the supreme and chief one.</p>

<p>Yet though the other Apostles were judges, with power
to bind and to loose, though they were present, and concerned,
for "Ananias bringing a certain part, laid it at
the feet of the Apostles," not of Peter only, it was not
they, but Peter, who entered on the cause of Ananias and
Sapphira, passed sentence, and inflicted punishment. Why
did he judge singly a cause which was brought before the
common tribunal of the Apostles? Because Peter was to
have the Primacy in all things; because from him the
model of ecclesiastical judgments was to be taken; because
the charge of maintaining ecclesiastical discipline belonged
in chief to him as the head.</p>

<p>VI. But no less <a name="FNanchor_61_264" id="FNanchor_61_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_264" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>markedly does Luke represent Peter
as everywhere visiting the Churches, providing for them
as universal pastor, and exercising herein the administrative
Primacy. "The Churches," he says, "throughout
all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace, being
edified and walking in the fear of the Lord, and were
multiplied by the consolation of the Holy Ghost. And
it came to pass <i>that Peter, as he passed through, visiting
all</i>, came to the saints who dwelt at Lydda."<a name="FNanchor_62_265" id="FNanchor_62_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_265" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> In
illustration of this we may remember Paul's charge to
Titus:<a name="FNanchor_63_266" id="FNanchor_63_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_266" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> "for this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>shouldst set in order the things that are wanting, and
shouldst ordain priests in every city, as I also appointed
thee." And again, what Luke writes of Paul himself:
"After some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and
visit our brethren in all the cities wherein we have preached
the word of the Lord, to see how they do."<a name="FNanchor_64_267" id="FNanchor_64_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_267" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> And what<a name="FNanchor_65_268" id="FNanchor_65_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_268" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Eusebius, from S. Clement, relates of S. John, that he
visited with authority the Churches of Asia, which he had
either founded, or specially attended to. By these passages
we see the nature of Peter's visitation, that it was
pastoral, and likewise the difference between his and these
others, for they were <i>local</i>, but his <i>universal</i>. Titus acted
in Crete, the special sphere of his labour, to which S. Paul
the founder of that Church had appointed him. Paul and
Barnabas propose to visit "our brethren <i>in every city in
which we have preached the word of the Lord</i>;" S. John
exerts visitatorial power over the churches of that province
wherein he dwelt, and that too, apparently, when he was
the sole survivor of the Apostolic college, yet did not go
into other parts. But Peter's charge is &oelig;cumenical, and
therefore his visitation universal. He inspects the labours
of others, as well as his own. For he was not the only
Apostle at Jerusalem, nor had he singly built up all the
churches of Judea, Galileo, and Samaria, yet he alone
makes a progress from Jerusalem to all these churches.
Though not the Bishop of Jerusalem, over which the Apostle
James presides, he goes everywhere, as "the Bishop of
Bishops."<a name="FNanchor_66_269" id="FNanchor_66_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_269" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> No other reason coherent with Scripture can
we find for this universal inspection of Peter; for all the
Apostles were indeed pastors, but he alone set over the
whole fold; he alone not limited, like Paul, "to the brethren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>in every city wherein he had preached." He differs
from all others as the universal from the particular, and so
S. Chrysostome says of him in this very passage, "like a
general he went round surveying the ranks, seeing what
portion was well massed together, what in order, what
needed his presence. Behold him making his rounds in
every direction."<a name="FNanchor_67_270" id="FNanchor_67_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_270" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>VII. Further, <a name="FNanchor_68_271" id="FNanchor_68_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_271" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>we may see the deference paid to this
supreme authority of Peter by the Apostles and ancients at
Jerusalem, on occasion of that severest dissension which
threatened the unity of the Church, and kindled the
greatest agitation, the question whether Gentile converts
should be bound to obey the Mosaic ritual law. For "the <a name="FNanchor_69_272" id="FNanchor_69_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_272" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>Apostles
and Ancients having assembled to consider of this
matter," after "there had been much disputing, Peter,
rising up, said to them." But why does Peter first rise and
decide the cause? Because he was first of the Apostles,
and as such supreme arbiter in controversy. But consider
what he says. "Men and brethren, you know that in former
days God made choice among us, that by my mouth
the Gentiles should hear the word of the Gospel, and
believe." <i>By my mouth</i>, he appeals to their knowledge of
his election by God to the singular privilege of receiving
the Gentiles: in virtue of that election he claims and
exercises authority. "And God, who knoweth the hearts,
gave testimony, giving unto them the Holy Ghost, as well
as unto us, and put no difference between us and them,
purifying their hearts by faith." God, therefore, has
already decided this controversy, by my ministry, whom He
specially called thereunto, and by the effects which He
caused to accompany it. Then, using words full of force,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>being, indeed, very like those in which he had answered
Ananias and Sapphira, he continues, "now, therefore, why
tempt you God, to put a yoke upon the necks of the disciples,
which neither our fathers, nor we, have been able to
bear? But by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ we
believe that we shall be saved, in like manner as they also."
"How full of power are these words," is the comment of S.
Chrysostome,<a name="FNanchor_70_273" id="FNanchor_70_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_273" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> "he says here what Paul has said at great
length in the Epistle to the Romans." And then, speaking
of the heads of Paul's doctrine, he adds, "the seeds of
all this lie in Peter's discourse." This, then, is a <i>decision</i>,
and given in no hesitating manner, but with severe censure
of those who maintained the opposite, as "tempting God,"
words suitable for him only to use who had authority over
all. But how did the council receive them? Though "there
had been much disputing before," though the keenest feelings
had been excited, and the point involved the strongest
prepossessions of the Jewish converts, "all the multitude
held their peace." They acquiesced in Peter's judgment,
and now readily "heard Barnabas and Paul telling what
great signs and wonders God had wrought among the
Gentiles by them." It follows, then, that on a capital
point, and in the first council of the Church, Peter occupied
a position which befits only the supreme judge of controversies,
so that had we no other evidence but this place
whereby to decide upon his rank and office, his pre-eminence
would be evident. "See," says S. Chrysostome,
"he first permits a discussion to arise in the Church, and
then he speaks."<a name="FNanchor_71_274" id="FNanchor_71_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_274" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>But is this affected by other persons likewise speaking
and voting, as Paul and Barnabas? or by S. James likewise
giving his sentence, as an Apostle? or by the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>matter being settled by common consent? As little as to
be <i>head</i> involves being <i>all</i>; as to preside over the rest
takes from them the power of deliberation, and resolution.
Rather it is the office of the Head and the President to
take the initiative, and point out the course which others
are to follow.</p>

<p>For those here present were teachers, and had the prerogative
of hearing and judging, as well as Peter; they
were bound to weigh the matter in controversy to the best
of their power, and to decide on it according to the proportion
of faith. They stood to Peter in a relation, not of
simple obedience, as the ordinary members of the flock, but
of judges, who, though responsible to his superintendence,
yet are really judges, pass sentence, and decree by inherent
authority. It is no part of the idea of a judge, that
he should be supreme and irresponsible: this is the <i>special</i>
privilege of the one supreme judge. Objections such as
these, therefore, do not take from Peter his Primacy, and
quality of Head, but claim for Paul, Barnabas, James, and
the other Apostles, the judicial authority and office, which
they undoubtedly possessed.</p>

<p>Nor again, that, not Peter only, but all, passed the
decree in common, as it is written: "It seemed good to
the Holy Ghost, and to us;" and as Paul and Timothy
"delivered to the cities the decrees to keep that were
decreed by the Apostles and Ancients."<a name="FNanchor_72_275" id="FNanchor_72_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_275" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> For a decree
made in common by many shews not an equality of power
in each, but a competent authority to join in that decree.
Such acts proceed, not only from equal, but from unequal
assemblies. A question, therefore, terminated by common
decision, and laws established by common consent, do
indeed prove a power to deliberate and decree common to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>all participating, but do not prove that all, and every, of
the judges were equal in their privileges, for who gives
to the Ancients the same authority as to the Apostles?</p>

<p>This inequality is elsewhere established, and rests on
its own proof, but bearing it in mind, we shall see that
Peter is the first and chief author of this common decree,
and that laws passed by common consent depend on him
primarily as Head. Most unsuspicious witnesses of this
are the ancient writers, and this is the very conclusion
which they drew from the account of this council. Thus,
Tertullian, in the second century, speaking of Peter's
singular prerogatives, says, "On him the Church was
built, that is, through him: it was he who hanselled the
key. This is it. 'Ye men of Israel, hear these words.
Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, &amp;c.'
He, too, first by Christian baptism opened the approach of
the heavenly kingdom, by which offences, heretofore bound,
are loosed, and those not loosed are bound, according to
true salvation. And Ananias he bound with the chain of
death: and him that was weak in his feet he delivered from
his disease. But likewise, in that discussion as to maintaining
the law, Peter, first of all, instinct with the Spirit, and
preluding with the vocation of the Gentiles, says, 'And
now why tempt ye the Lord, by imposing a yoke on the
brethren, which neither we, nor our fathers have been able
to bear? But by the grace of Christ we believe that we
shall be saved, as also they.' <i>This</i> <span class="smcap">sentence</span> <i>both loosed
what was given up of the law, and kept binding what was
reserved</i>."<a name="FNanchor_73_276" id="FNanchor_73_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_276" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> As clearly, S. Jerome, in the fourth century,
writes, that Peter "used his wonted freedom, and that the
Apostle James <i>followed his sentence</i>, and all the ancients at
once <i>acceded to it, and that the decree was drawn upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>his wording</i>."<a name="FNanchor_74_277" id="FNanchor_74_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_277" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> A little later Theodoret wrote to S. Leo,
thus: "If Paul, the preacher of the truth, the trumpet of
the Holy Spirit, hastened to the great Peter, to carry from
him the solution to those at Antioch, at issue about living
under the law; much more do we, poor and humble,
run to your Apostolic throne, to receive from you healing
for the wounds of the Churches."<a name="FNanchor_75_278" id="FNanchor_75_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_278" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Why does he here
call Peter, <i>the great</i>, or say that Paul hastened to him for
solution of a grave contention? Did not Paul go to all the
Apostles? But Peter was the head among them, and had
a power in chief&mdash;a power above the rest, a "more special"
power&mdash;of binding and loosing.</p>

<p>VIII. One other <a name="FNanchor_76_279" id="FNanchor_76_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_279" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>instance there is of Peter's superior
dignity, and therefore importance, in the Apostolic college,
which if, perhaps, less direct than some of the foregoing,
is even more persuasive. For there was an Apostle associated,
as we have seen, by our Lord with Peter and John
in several favours not granted to the rest; one who with
John received from Him the name Boanerges; the elder
brother of John, who with him had once asked to sit on
the Lord's right hand and on His left in His kingdom.
Now Luke is led in the course of his narrative to mention
the martyrdom of this great and favoured Apostle; the
first likewise of the Apostolic choir who drank, as he had
promised, of His Lord's baptism, and sealed his labours
and trials with his blood. The occasion was a great and
striking one. It is thus recorded by Luke. "And at the
same time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to
afflict some of the Church. And he killed James, the
brother of John, with the sword." This is the first and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>the last time that he is mentioned by himself in Luke's
inspired history of the universal Church. Great as he
was, so eminently favoured by his Lord, the elder brother
of John, nothing is said of the Church's anxiety for his
danger, her prayers for his release, her sorrow at his
loss, or her exultation at his triumph by witnessing unto
blood. He passed to his throne in heaven with this short
record. The more emphatic is the contrast following.
"And seeing that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to take
up Peter also. Now it was in the days of the azymes.
And when he had apprehended him, he cast him into
prison, delivering him to four files of soldiers to be kept,
intending after the pasch to bring him forth to the people.
Peter therefore was kept in prison. <i>But prayer was
made without ceasing by the Church unto God for him.</i>"
That is, by the instinct of self-preservation she prayed
for her head. A few years later another Apostle, after
glorious labours by land and sea, and missions of unrivalled
success, was seized and imprisoned in this same
city of Jerusalem, and in danger of his life. But we do
not hear of prayers being offered up without ceasing even
for Paul, the doctor of the nations. The Church's safety
was not bound up with his, any more than with that
of James, and therefore not even of the great preacher
"in labours more abundant than all," are we told that
in the hour of danger "prayer was made without
ceasing by the Church unto God for him." James
and Paul were most distinguished <i>members</i>, but Peter
was more. This was an honour reserved for the Head
alone, as the life of the Head was peculiarly precious
to the whole body. Thus S. Chrysostome explains
it.  "The prayer is a proof of affection: they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
sought for a Father, a kind Father."<a name="FNanchor_77_280" id="FNanchor_77_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_280" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> And then Luke
proceeds to give at length Peter's delivery out of prison
by the angel, and his departure in safety to another place.
But there is no other solution of such a difference in recording
what happened alike to James, to Peter, and to
Paul, but that Peter held the place of father in the Lord's
family, of commander in His army, of steward in His
household, delivering to each of His servants their measure
of wheat in due season.</p>

<p>The result,<a name="FNanchor_78_281" id="FNanchor_78_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_281" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> then, of our particular enquiry in the Acts
is to demonstrate two things, that Peter discharged the
office of Father and Head in the Lord's family, and that
the Church received and admitted him when so acting,
with a consciousness that such was the will of Christ.</p>

<p>Now this office did not consist in "lording it" over his
brethren, in assuming high titles, and interfering with
the ministry of others when exercised in its due course,
in rejecting their assistance, or impeding the unanimous
exercise of their counsel. On the contrary, the Lord had
before prescribed that "the greater" among them should
be as the younger, and "the leader" as he that ministers,
proposing to them Himself as the great model, who had
exercised the highest power with the utmost gentleness,
and, being "the Lord," had become "the servant of all."
What, then, did this office of Primate consist in? We
may say that Peter was undoubtedly such, if he constantly
exercised the power of a head in building up the
Church, in maintaining discipline, in reconciling dissensions,
and in general administration. Now it would be
doing Peter wrong to suppose that he usurped as peculiar
to himself what equally belonged to all the Apostles;
or that, having received the special power of the Holy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>Ghost, he did not fulfil his own advice to others, "not
to lord it over the clergy, but to be made a pattern of
the flock."<a name="FNanchor_79_282" id="FNanchor_79_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_282" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> And the four points just mentioned may
be reduced to a triple authority, a Primacy <i>magisterial</i>,
<i>judicial</i>, and <i>legislative</i>. Let us take in at one glance
what has been said of Peter in regard to each of these.</p>

<p>As to the <i>magisterial</i>, or power of authoritative teaching,
and general administration, Peter is constantly taking
the lead, he is the mouthpiece of the Apostles: he alone,
or he first, by teaching plants the Churches; he alone, or
he in chief, completes them when planted; he it is who
by divine revelation given to himself, discloses to the rest
the dispensation of God; and he in words full of power
sets forth to these assembled in council the course which
they are to pursue.</p>

<p>As to the <i>judicial</i>, none other judgments are found in
that portion of the Acts which contains the history of the
whole Church, save those of which he was either the <i>sole</i>
or the <i>chief</i> author. Alone he took cognisance of Ananias
and Sapphira, and alone he punished them. And Simon
he censured in chief, and excommunicated.</p>

<p>As to the <i>legislative</i>, Peter alone promulged the law
as to receiving the Gentiles; alone he prescribed that for
abrogating the Mosaic ceremonial ordinances; and he was
the chief author of the decree which expressed in terms
his own previous act, and was put forth in common by the
Apostles and Ancients.<a name="FNanchor_80_283" id="FNanchor_80_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_283" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Again, compare the <i>institution</i> of the Primacy with its
<i>exercise</i>. Its institution consisted in three things. 1. That
Peter was named by Christ the foundation of the Church,
with whom its whole fabric was most intimately to cohere,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>and from whom it should derive visible unity and impregnable
strength: 2. That the authority of universal pastor, and
the care of the whole fold, was committed to him: 3.
That to him belonged the confirmation of his brethren,
and a power of the keys to which all were subject. Now
consider the execution.</p>

<p>As foundation of the Church, he gathers up to himself
congregations from the Jews, the Samaritans, and the
Gentiles.</p>

<p>As universal pastor, he collects from these three the
flock, nourishes, defends, inspects it, and fills up one place
of highest rank in the ministry forfeited by the traitor.</p>

<p>As confirmer of the brethren, he disclosed to them the
heavenly vision signifying the universal calling of the
Gentiles, and the abrogation of the Mosaic law. He
acts in the Lord's household as the bearer of the keys,
going to all parts, defending and inspecting all. By himself
he binds and looses, calling Ananias and Sapphira to
his tribunal, and excommunicating the first heretic.</p>

<p>So exactly, then, do the institution of the Primacy and
the acts of Peter fit into each other, that from the former
you may predict the latter, and from the latter prove the
former. They are like cause and effect, or an à priori
and an à posteriori argument. They are a reciprocal confirmation
to each other; just as if by time you calculate
the sun's rising, and see the diffusion of his light, from his
having risen you infer his light, and from his light conclude
that he has risen.</p>

<p>Nor in the Apostolic Church does any one appear to
resist or question this office of Peter. Rather upon him
all eyes are fixed, for him all are anxious; no Abiram
rises up against him with the words of rebellion; "Thou
takest too much upon thee, seeing all the congregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among
them, wherefore then liftest thou up thyself above the
congregation of the Lord?"<a name="FNanchor_81_284" id="FNanchor_81_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_284" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> No Aaron in a moment of
delusion cries, "Did the Lord speak by Moses only? hath
He not spoken also by us?"</p>

<p>Yet Peter acts not like one out of a number, and occasions
of contention are not wanting, strong prepossessions
and keen feelings.<a name="FNanchor_82_285" id="FNanchor_82_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_285" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> He is everywhere; his pre-eminence
and his control are universal: he can act with
severity, and there are some impatient even of a just
control. When Ananias and Sapphira fell dead at his
feet, none murmured. When he exclaimed, in full council,
"now, therefore, why tempt you God?" the whole multitude
was silent. When he explained the reception of
the Gentiles, those who had murmured "held their peace,
and glorified God."<a name="FNanchor_83_286" id="FNanchor_83_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_286" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>But had Peter not possessed, by divine commission, the
authority which he exercised, it is clear, from the conduct
of Paul, that he would have met with opposition from each
in proportion to his advance in Christian perfection. Paul's
censure of his indulgence to the prejudices of the circumcision,
proceeding as it did from charity, shews this. But
what would Paul, and what would the other Apostles
have done, had they seen Peter perpetually taking the
lead, and exercising the power of a head, without any
special title thereto? Would they not have resisted him
to the face, and before all, and declared that there was
no difference of authority between them? Yet, not a trace
of such resistance appears, while on numberless occasions
the Apostles, and the whole assembly of the faithful, yield
to him the Primacy, a sign truly that they recognized in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>him one who had received the place of Christ as visible
Head among them.</p>

<p>The place of Christ <i>as visible Head</i>, for infinite indeed
is the distance between Christ and Peter, as to the headship
of mystical influx and the source of grace. Neither he nor
any creature has part with Christ as to this latter, of which
Paul writes, "that God hath set all things under His feet,
and given Him to be Head over all to the Church, which is
His body, the fulness of Him who filleth all in all;" of
which again, "from whom the whole body, being compacted
and fitly joined together, by what every joint supplieth,
according to the operation in the measure of every part
maketh increase of the body, unto the edifying of itself in
charity;" and "the husband is the head of the wife, as
Christ is the head of the Church, and He is the Saviour of
His body:" and all this "to present it to Himself a glorious
Church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such
thing."<a name="FNanchor_84_287" id="FNanchor_84_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_287" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In <i>this</i> sense Headship belongs to Christ, not
only first and chiefly, but absolutely and solely. But, as to
the Headship of external government and visible unity,
though here also the same Apostle calls Him, "the head of
the body the Church, who is the beginning, the first-born
from the dead; that in all things He may hold the primacy,"<a name="FNanchor_85_288" id="FNanchor_85_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_288" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
to this Christ Himself has in a measure associated
Peter by saying to him specially, "Feed My sheep&mdash;follow
thou Me."</p>

<p>And observe how that divine injunction was fulfilled.
For as following our Lord with loving gaze through the
Gospels we see every object grouped about that heavenly
figure of His; as our eyes rest ever upon Him in the synagogue,
in the market-place, among the crowd, before the
Pharisees, the elders, the chief priests, healing the sick,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>raising the dead, supporting and animating His disciples&mdash;so
turning to the Acts we see a human copy indeed of that
Divine portrait, but still one wrought by the Holy Spirit
out of our redeemed flesh and blood. We see the fervent
Apostle treading in his master's steps, the centre and the
support of his brethren, the first before the Council, and
before the people, ready with his words and his deeds,
uttering to the dead, as the echo of his Lord, "Arise,"
and healing the sick with his shadow. With reason, then,
do the inspired writers use of Peter and of Christ similar
forms of speech, and as they write, "Jesus, and His disciples,"
"there went with Him His disciples," "there He
abode with His disciples," so they write, "Peter standing up
with the Eleven," "they said to Peter and to the rest of
the Apostles," "Peter and the Apostles answering." What
above all is remarkable is to observe the same <i>proportion</i>
between the figure of Peter and the Apostles in the first
twelve chapters of the Acts, as between the figure of our
Lord and the Apostles in the Gospel. Such was the power
and the will of the Divine Master when He said, "Feed My
sheep; follow thou Me." Such the truth of the disciple,
answering, "Lord, Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest
that I love Thee."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<h3>TESTIMONY OF S. PAUL TO S. PETER'S PRIMACY.</h3>


<p>In leaving the Gospels and the Acts we quit those
writings in which we should expect, beforehand, that divine
government to be set forth, which it pleased our Lord to
establish for His church. In exact accordance with such
expectation we have seen the institution of the apostolic
college, and of S. Peter's Primacy over it, described in the
Gospels, and the history in the Acts of its execution and
practical working. Both institution and execution have
been complete in their parts, and wonderfully harmonise
with each other. But in the other inspired writings of the
New Testament, comprising the letters of various Apostles,
and specially of S. Paul, we had no reason to anticipate
any detailed mention of Church government. The fourteen
Epistles of S. Paul were written incidentally on different
subjects, no one of them leading him to set forth, with any
exact specification, that divine hierarchy under which it was
the pleasure of the Lord that His Church should grow up.
Moreover, it so happened that the <a name="FNanchor_1_289" id="FNanchor_1_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_289" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>circumstances of S.
Paul's calling to be an Apostle, and the opposition which he
sometimes met with from those attached to Jewish usages,
caused him to be a great defender of the Apostolic dignity,
as bestowed upon himself, and continually to assert that he
received it not of men, but of God. Had there, then, been
no recognition at all of S. Peter's superior rank in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Apostolic College to be found in his writings, it would not
have caused surprise to those who consider the above
reasons. And proportionably strong and effective is the
recognition of that rank, which, though incidental, does
occur, and that several times. If, then, S. Paul, being
so circumstanced, selected expressions which seem to indicate
a distinction of dignity between the Apostles and
S. Peter, they claim a special attention, and carry a
double force. Now on putting these together we shall
find that they show not merely a distinction of dignity,
but a superior authority, in Peter.</p>

<p>The first are four several passages in the first Epistle
to the Corinthians, in all of which S. Peter holds the
higher place, and in two is moreover mentioned singly,
while the rest are mentioned only in mass. These are
the following, "Now this I say, that every one of you
saith: I indeed am of Paul; and I of Apollo; and I of
Cephas; and I of Christ." Again: "All things are yours,
whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world,
or life, or death, or things present, or things to come, for
all are yours, and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's."
Again, "Have we not power to carry about a woman, a
sister, as well as the rest of the Apostles, and the brethren
of the Lord, and Cephas?" And once more: "That He
was seen by Cephas, and after that by the eleven."<a name="FNanchor_2_290" id="FNanchor_2_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_290" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> First,
we may remark that the place of dignity in a sentence
varies<a name="FNanchor_3_291" id="FNanchor_3_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_291" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> according to its nature: if it <i>descends</i>, such place
is the first; but if it <i>ascends</i>, it is the furthest point from
the first. Now in the first instance the discourse ascends,
for what can be plainer than that it terminates in Christ,
as in the supreme point?  "Every one of you saith, I
indeed am of Paul, and I of Apollo, and I of Cephas, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>I of Christ;" so S. Chrysostome observes, "It was not
to prefer himself before Peter that he set him last,
but to prefer Peter even greatly before himself. For
he speaks in the ascending scale:" and Theodoret:
"They called themselves from different teachers: now he
mentioned his own name and that of Apollo: but
he adds also the name of the chief of the Apostles."<a name="FNanchor_4_292" id="FNanchor_4_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_292" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
As plain is this in the second instance, where S. Paul,
developing his thought, "all things are yours," adds,
"whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas," or if that be not
sufficient, "the world" itself, which, carried away in a
sort of transport, he seems to divide into its parts, "or
life, or death, or things present, or things to come, all,"
I repeat, "are yours:" but only, you are not your own,
"you are Christ's, and Christ is God's." In all which,
from human instruments, who plant and water, he rises
up to God, the ultimate source, the beginning and the
end. Stronger yet is the third passage, for being in the
very act of setting forth the dignity of his own Apostolate,
"have we not power," he says, "to lead about a sister, a
woman, as well as the rest of the Apostles, and the brethren
of the Lord, and Cephas?" Now, whether "the rest of the
Apostles" here means, those who, in the looser signification
are so called, as "the Apostles of the Churches,"
and "Andronicus, and Junias&mdash;who are of note among
the Apostles,"<a name="FNanchor_5_293" id="FNanchor_5_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_293" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or the original Twelve, the ascending
scale is equally apparent. For why is Peter distinguished
by name from all the rest? Why alone termed by his
prophetical name? S. Chrysostome, again tells us why.
"Look at Paul's wisdom. <i>He puts the chief the last.
For there he puts that which was strongest among the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>principal. For it was not so remarkable to shew the
rest doing this, as him that was chief, and had been
entrusted with the keys of heaven.</i> But he puts not
him alone, but all, as if he would say, whether you look
for inferiors, or superiors, you have examples of all. For
the brethren of the Lord, being delivered from their first
unbelief,<a name="FNanchor_6_294" id="FNanchor_6_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_294" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> were among the principal, though they had not
reached the height of Apostles, and, therefore, he put them
in the middle, with the highest on the two sides:"<a name="FNanchor_7_295" id="FNanchor_7_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_295" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> words
in which he seems to indicate that Peter was as excellent
among the Apostles, as they among the rest of the disciples,
and the Lord's brethren.</p>

<p>Of the superiority contained in the fourth passage,
we have spoken above, under another head: and, therefore,
proceed to much more remarkable testimonies of S.
Paul.</p>

<p>In the epistle to the Galatians, S. Paul has occasion<a name="FNanchor_8_296" id="FNanchor_8_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_296" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> to
defend his Apostolic authority, and the agreement of the
Gospel which he had preached with that of the original
Apostles. After referring to his marvellous conversion,
he continues, "immediately I condescended not to flesh
and blood; neither went I to Jerusalem to the Apostles,
who were before me, but I went into Arabia, and again I
returned to Damascus. Then, after three years, I went
to Jerusalem, to visit Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen
days. But other of the Apostles I saw none, saving James,
the brother of the Lord." At length, then, S. Paul goes
to Jerusalem, and that with a fixed purpose, "to visit
Peter." But why Peter only, and not the rest of the
Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord?<a name="FNanchor_9_297" id="FNanchor_9_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_297" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Why speaks
he of these, and of James himself, besides, as if he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>intimate that he had little care of seeing them? No other
answer can be given to such queries, than is shadowed
out in the prophetic name of Peter, and contained in the
explanation of it given by Christ Himself, "Upon this
Rock I will build My Church."</p>

<p>For, to prove this, let us go back once more to witnesses
beyond suspicion, who wrote a thousand years before the
denial of Peter's Primacy began. The Greek and Latin
Fathers see here a recognition of his chief authority. Thus
Theodoret, "Not needing doctrines from man, as having
received it from the God of all, he gives the fitting honour
to the chief." Theodoret follows S. Chrysostome, who
had said, "After so many great deeds, needing nothing
of Peter, nor of his instruction, but being his equal in
rank, for I will say no more here, still he goes up to
him as to the greater and elder:" his equal in the
Apostolic dignity, and the immediate reception of his
authority from Christ, but yet his inferior in the range
of his jurisdiction, Peter being "greater and elder." And
he goes on, "he went, but for this alone, to see him and
honour him by his presence. He says, I went up to
visit Peter. He said not to see Peter, but to visit Peter,
as they say, in becoming acquainted with great and
illustrious cities. So much pains he thought it worth
only to see the man." And he concludes, "This I repeat,
and would have you remember, lest you should suspect
the Apostle, on hearing anything which seems said against
Peter. For it was for this that he so speaks, correcting
by anticipation, that when he shall say, I resisted Peter,
no one may think these words of enmity and contention.
For he honours the man, and loves him more than all.
For he says that he came up for none of the Apostles,
save him." Elsewhere, S. Chrysostome, commenting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
the charge, Feed My sheep, asks, "Why, then, passing
by the rest, does He converse with him (Peter) on these
things?" And he replies, Peter "was the one preferred
among the Apostles, and the mouth-piece of the disciples,
and the head of the band: <i>therefore</i>, too, Paul then went
up to visit him <i>rather than the rest</i>."<a name="FNanchor_10_298" id="FNanchor_10_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_298" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Tertullian, the
most ancient of the Latins, says, "then, as he relates
himself, he went up to Jerusalem for the purpose of
becoming acquainted with Peter, that is, according to
duty, and the claim of their identical faith and preaching:"<a name="FNanchor_11_299" id="FNanchor_11_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_299" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>
the <i>duty</i>, which Paul had to Peter; the <i>claim</i>
which Peter had on Paul. In the fourth century, Marius
Victorinus observes: "After three years, says he, I
came to Jerusalem; then he adds the cause, to see Peter.
For if the foundation of the Church was laid in Peter,
as is said in the Gospel, Paul, to whom all things had
been revealed, knew that he was <i>bound</i> to see Peter, as
one to whom so great an authority had been given by
Christ, not to learn anything from him."<a name="FNanchor_12_300" id="FNanchor_12_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_300" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The writer
called Ambrosiaster, as his works are attached to those
of S. Ambrose, and contemporary with Pope Damasus,
(<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 366-384) remarks, "It was proper that he should
desire to see Peter, because he was first among the
Apostles, to whom the Saviour had committed the care
of the Churches." S. Jerome, more largely, says, "not
to behold his eyes, his cheeks, or his countenance, whether
he were thin or stout, with nose straight or twisted, covered
with hair, or as Clement, in the Periods, will have it, bald.
It was not, I conceive, in the gravity of an Apostle, that
after so long as three years' preparation, he could wish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>to see anything human in Peter. But he gazed on him
with those eyes with which now he is seen in his own
letters. Paul saw Cephas with eyes such as those with
which all wise men now look on Paul. If any one thinks
otherwise, let him join all this with the sense before indicated,
that the Apostles contributed nothing to each other.
For even in that he seemed to go to Jerusalem, in order
that he might see the Apostle, it was not to learn, as
having himself too the same author of his preaching, but
<i>to shew honour to the first Apostle</i>."<a name="FNanchor_13_301" id="FNanchor_13_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_301" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Our own S.
Thomas sums up all these in saying, "the doctor of the
Gentiles, who boasts that he had learnt the Gospel, not
of man, nor through man, but instructed by Christ, went
up to Jerusalem, conferred concerning the faith <i>with the
head of the Churches</i>, lest perchance he might run, or
had run, in vain."<a name="FNanchor_14_302" id="FNanchor_14_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_302" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>These last words lead us attentively to consider the
passage which follows in S. Paul. At a subsequent
period the zealots of the law had raised against him
a report that the Gospel which he preached differed from
that of the Twelve. At once to meet and silence such a
calumny, he tells us that "after fourteen years, I went
up again to Jerusalem, with Barnabas, taking Titus also
with me. And I went up according to revelation, and,"
assigning the particular purpose, "conferred with them
the Gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but apart
with them who seemed to be something; lest, perhaps, I
should run, or had run, in vain." Then, having proved
the identity of his doctrine with that of those who "seemed
to be something," that is, Peter, James, and John, though
to him they "added nothing," he specifies Peter among
these, and proceeds to draw a singular parallel between, on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>the one hand, Peter, as accompanied by James and John,
and himself, as working with Barnabas and Titus. If we
set the clauses over against each other, this will be more
apparent:&mdash;</p>

<p>where it would appear that James and John stand in the
like relation to Cephas, as Barnabas and Titus, just before
mentioned, to Paul. And S. Chrysostome, who, it must
be remarked, reads Cephas, and not James, first, as do
some manuscripts and many Fathers, observes, "where it
was requisite to compare himself, he mentions Peter only,
but were to call a testimony, he names three together and
with praise, saying, 'Cephas, and James, and John, who
seemed to be pillars.'" And further, Paul "shows himself
to be of the same rank with them, and matches himself
not with the rest, but with the leader, showing that
each of them enjoyed the same dignity,"<a name="FNanchor_16_304" id="FNanchor_16_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_304" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that is, of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>Apostolic commission, and the divine cooperation. And
Ambrosiaster explains the parallel: "Paul names Peter only,
and compares him to himself, as having received the Primacy
<i>for the founding of the Church</i>, he being in like manner
elected to hold a Primacy <i>in founding the Churches
of the Gentiles</i>, yet so that Peter, if occasion might be,
should preach to the Gentiles, and Paul to the Jews.
For both are found to have done both." And presently,
"by the Apostles who were the more illustrious among
the rest, whom for their stability he names pillars, and
who were ever in the Lord's secret council, being worthy
to behold His glory on the mount," (where Ambrosiaster
confuses James, the brother of the Lord, with James
the brother of John,) "by these he declares to have been
approved the gift which he received from God, that he should
be worthy to hold the Primacy in the preaching of the
Gentiles, as Peter held it in the preaching of the circumcision.
<i>And as he assigns to Peter for companions
distinguished men among the Apostles, so he joins Barnabas
to himself; yet he claims to himself alone the
grace of the Primacy as granted by God, like as to
Peter alone it was granted among the Apostles</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17_305" id="FNanchor_17_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_305" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>Now Baronius proves that the above words cannot be
taken of a division of jurisdiction, and that the singular
dignity of Peter is marked in them. "For as a mark
of his excellence Christ Himself, who came to save all
men, with whom there is no distinction of Jew and Greek,
was yet called 'minister of the circumcision,' by Paul,
(Rom. xv. 8,) a title of dignity, according to Paul's own
words, for theirs was 'the adoption of children, and the
glory, and the testament, and the giving of the law,
and the service of God, and the promises,' while 'the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>Gentiles praise God for His mercy,' But just as Christ
our Lord was so called minister of the circumcision, as
yet to be the Pastor and Saviour of all, so Peter too
was called the minister of the circumcision, in such
sense as yet to be by the Lord constituted (Acts ix.
32,) pastor and ruler of the whole flock. Whence S.
Leo, 'out of the whole world Peter alone is chosen
to preside over the calling of all the Gentiles, and over
all the Apostles, and the collected Fathers of the Church,
so that though there be among the people of God many
priests and many shepherds, yet Peter rules all by immediate
commission, whom Christ also rules by Sovereign
power.'"<a name="FNanchor_18_306" id="FNanchor_18_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_306" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The parallel, then, drawn by Paul between himself and
Peter, distinctly conveys that as he was superior to Barnabas
and Titus, and used their cooperation, so was Peter
among the Apostles, and specially the chief ones, James
and John, as their leader and head. For what is the
meaning of the words, "He who wrought in Peter to
the Apostleship of the circumcision?" Was the Apostleship
of the circumcision entrusted to Peter only? It
needs no proof that it was also entrusted to James and
John, nay, Paul himself immediately says so, "They gave
to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that
<i>we</i> should go unto the Gentiles, and <i>they</i> unto the circumcision."
Why then does Paul so express himself as
to intimate that the Gospel of the circumcision was given
to Peter only? For the same reason that he said that
to himself "was committed the Gospel of the uncircumcision,"
and that God "wrought in me also among the
Gentiles." Now Barnabas likewise had been<a name="FNanchor_19_307" id="FNanchor_19_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_307" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>separated
by the Holy Ghost Himself for the Gentile mission; Barnabas,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>too, and Titus were discharging the office of ambassadors
for Christ among the Gentiles: "that <i>we</i>," Paul
says, not I, "should go to the Gentiles." The terms,
therefore, used by Paul both of himself and Peter, do
not <i>exclude</i> the rest, but express the <i>superiority</i> of the
one named singly before the rest, as if he alone held the
charge. Their fittest interpretation, then, will be, "The
Apostles saw that the Gospel of the uncircumcision was
no less given to me <i>above</i> the rest, than the Gospel of
the circumcision to Peter <i>above</i> the rest; for He who
wrought in Peter <i>above</i> the rest in the Gospel of the
circumcision, wrought also in me <i>above</i> the rest in the
Gospel of the uncircumcision." But what can set forth
S. Peter's dignity more remarkably than to exhibit him
in the same light of superiority among the original Apostles,
as S. Paul was among S. Barnabas and his other
fellow-workers?</p>

<p>Further confirmation of this is given by the argument
with which he refutes the calumny urged against him
of disagreement with the Apostles. For while he appeals
to them <i>in general</i>, and to his union with them, he likewise
<i>specifies</i> the point which favoured that union. It
was the parallel between himself and Peter, as we have
seen; it was the exact resemblance between his mission
and that of Peter, which was the cause of their joining
hands: they approve Paul's Apostleship because they see
that it follows the type of Peter's.</p>

<p>And other words of Paul which follow, prove not only
the point of his own cause, but the source of Peter's
singular privileges. "But when Cephas was come to
Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was
to be blamed: for before that some came from James,
he did eat with the Gentiles; but when they were come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
he withdrew, and separated himself, fearing them who
were of the circumcision. And to his dissimulation the
rest of the Jews consented, so that Barnabas also was
led by them into that dissimulation. But when I saw
that they walked not uprightly unto the truth of the
Gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, If thou being
a Jew livest after the manner of the Gentiles, and not
as the Jews do, how dost thou compel the Gentiles to
live as the Jews?" For why did Paul here censure Peter
<i>only</i>? By his own account not only Peter, but the rest,
and Barnabas himself amongst them, set apart as he was
by the Holy Ghost to preach to the Gentiles, did not
defend Christian liberty, as they ought to have done.
Why, then, does he single out Peter among all these,
resist him to the face, and so firmly censure all, in his
person? No answer can be given but one: that by this
dissembling of Peter the zealots of the law gathered
double courage to press against Paul their calumny of
dissension from Peter, and to infer that he had run in
vain, from the indulgence which Peter showed; that
Peter's authority with all was so great that his example
drew the pastors and their flocks alike to his side, and
that it was requisite to correct the members in the head.
From this S. Chrysostome proves that it was really the
Apostle Peter, which some, as we shall soon see, denied:
"For to say, that I resisted him to the face, and to put
this as a great thing, was to show that he had not
reverenced the dignity of his person. But had he said it
of another, that I resisted him to the face, he would not
have put it as a great thing. Again, if it had been
another Peter, his change would have not had such force
as to draw the rest of the Jews with him. For he used
no exhortation, nor advice, but merely dissembled, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
separated himself, and that dissembling and separation
had power to draw after him all the disciples, <i>on account
of the dignity of his person</i>."<a name="FNanchor_20_308" id="FNanchor_20_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_308" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Again, another writer
of the fourth century tells us this: "Therefore he inveighs
against Peter alone, in order that the rest might learn
in the person of him who is the first."<a name="FNanchor_21_309" id="FNanchor_21_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_309" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It was, then,
Peter's primacy, and the necessity of agreeing with him
thence arising, which led Paul to resist him publicly,
and, disregarding the conduct of the rest, to direct an
admonition to him alone. "So great," S. Jerome tells
us, on these two passages, "was Peter's authority, that
Paul in his epistle wrote, 'Then after three years I went
to Jerusalem to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen
days.' And again in what follows, 'After fourteen years
I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking
Titus also with me. And I went up according to revelation,
and conferred with them the Gospel which I preach
among the Gentiles,' <i>showing that he had no security in
preaching the Gospel, unless it were confirmed by the
sentence of Peter and those who were with him</i>."<a name="FNanchor_22_310" id="FNanchor_22_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_310" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>But this passage,<a name="FNanchor_23_311" id="FNanchor_23_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_311" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> concerning the reprehension of S.
Peter by S. Paul, has afforded so signal an instance
"of the unlearned and unstable wresting Scripture to
their own proper destruction,"<a name="FNanchor_24_312" id="FNanchor_24_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_312" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> that we must dwell a
little longer upon it. First, the Gnostics and the Marcionites
quoted it to accuse the Apostles of ignorance,
and to favour their own claim to a progressive light. In
Peter, they would have it, there was still a taint of
Judaism. Next Porphyry, who "raged against Christ
like a mad dog,"<a name="FNanchor_25_313" id="FNanchor_25_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_313" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> tried by this passage to weaken the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>authority of the Apostles, and to convict Paul of ambition
and rashness, who censured the first of the Apostles
and the leader of the band, not privately, but openly
before all, as S. Chrysostome and S. Jerome tell us.
Julian the apostate succeeded these, and tried, by means
of Paul's contention with Peter, to bring discredit on
the religion itself. For who, he asked, could value a
religion whose chief teachers were guilty of hypocrisy,
ignorance, and ambition? And in complete accordance
with the spirit of these, all, who, since the sixteenth
century, have attempted to impugn S. Peter's prerogatives,
have rested their chief effort on the exaggeration
and distortion of this reprehension. "This," says Baronius,
"is the stone of stumbling, and rock of offence,
on which a great number have dashed themselves. For
those, who without any diligent consideration have superficially
interpreted a difficult statement, have gone so far
in their folly as either to accuse Paul of rashness for
having inveighed against Peter not merely with freedom,
but wantonness, or to calumniate Peter as a hypocrite,
for acting with dissimulation; or to condemn both, for
not agreeing in the same rule of faith."<a name="FNanchor_26_314" id="FNanchor_26_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_314" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>In most remarkable contrast with these stand out three
several interpretations, which prevailed in early times, all
differing from each other in points, but all equally careful
to maintain the dignity of Peter, and to clear up the conduct
of Paul. First, from S. Clement of Alexandria in
the second century up to S. Chrysostome in the fourth, we
find a number of Greek writers asserting that it was not
the Apostle Peter, who was here meant, but another; S.
Jerome gives their reasons thus: "there are those who
think that Cephas, whom Paul here writes that he resisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>to the face, was not the Apostle Peter, but another of the
seventy disciples so called, and they allege that Peter could
not have withdrawn himself from eating with the Gentiles,
for he had baptized Cornelius the centurion, and on his
ascending to Jerusalem, being opposed by those of the circumcision
who said, 'why hast thou entered in to men uncircumcised,
and eaten with them?' after narrating the
vision, he terminates his answer thus: 'If, then, God hath
given to them the same grace as to us who believe in the
Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I should withstand God?'
On hearing which they were silent, and glorified God,
saying: 'Therefore to the Gentiles, also, God hath given
repentance unto life.' Especially as Luke, the writer of
the history, makes no mention of this dissension, nor even
says that Peter was at Antioch with Paul; and occasion
would be given to Porphyry's blasphemies, <i>if we could
believe either that Peter had erred, or that Paul had
impertinently censured the prince of the Apostles</i>."<a name="FNanchor_27_315" id="FNanchor_27_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_315" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>But this interpretation, contrary both to internal evidence
and to early tradition, and suggested only by the
anxiety to defend S. Peter's dignity, did not prevail.
Another succeeded, supported by S. Chrysostome, S. Cyril,
and the greatest Greek commentators, and for a long time
by S. Jerome, even more remarkably opposed to the apparent
sense of the passage, and only, as it would seem,
dictated by the same desire to defend the dignity of
S. Peter, and the conduct of S. Paul. Admitting that it
was really Peter who was here mentioned, they maintained
that it was not a real dissension between the two
Apostles, but apparent only, and arranged both by the
one and the other, to terminate the question more decidedly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>S. Chrysostome<a name="FNanchor_28_316" id="FNanchor_28_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_316" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> sets forth at great length this
opinion: "Do you see," says he, "how S. Paul accounts
himself the least of all saints, not of Apostles only?
Now he who was so disposed with respect to all, both
knew how great a prerogative Peter ought to enjoy,
and reverenced him most of all men, and was disposed
towards him as he deserved. And this is a proof. The
whole earth was looking to Paul; there rested on his
spirit the solicitude for the Churches of all the world.
A thousand matters engaged him every day; he was
besieged with appointments, commands, corrections, counsels,
exhortations, teachings, the administration of endless
business; yet giving up all these, he went to Jerusalem.
And there was no other occasion for this journey save
to see Peter, as he says himself: 'I went up to Jerusalem
to visit Peter.' Thus he honoured him, and preferred
him to all men." Suspecting, too, that an accusation
against Peter's unwavering faith, might be brought from
the words, "fearing those of the circumcision," he breaks
out, 'What say you? Peter fearful and unmanly? Was
he not for this called Peter, that his faith was immovable?
What are you doing, friend? Reverence the name given
by the Lord to the disciple. Peter fearful and unmanly!
Who will endure you saying such things?'"</p>

<p>Now compare<a name="FNanchor_29_317" id="FNanchor_29_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_317" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> together these two interpretations of the
Greek Fathers with that of the reformers and their adherents
since the sixteenth century. A more complete antagonism
of feelings and principles cannot be conceived.
I. There is not a Greek Father who does not infer the singular
authority of Peter from the first and second chapter
of the epistle to the Galatians. There is not an adherent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>of the reformers who does not trust that he can draw from
those same chapters matter to impugn S. Peter's Primacy.
II.  The Greek Fathers anxiously search out every point
which may conduce to Peter's praise. The adherent of the
reformers suppresses all such, and seems not to see them.
III.  If anything in Paul's account seems at first sight to
tell against Peter's special dignity, the Greek Fathers are
studious carefully to remove it; the adherents of the reformers
to exaggerate it. IV. The Greek Fathers prefer
slightly to force the obvious meaning of the words, and to
desert the original interpretation, rather than set Apostles
at variance with each other, or admit that Peter, the chief
of the Apostles, was not treated with due deference. The
adherents of the reformers intensify everything, take it in
the worst sense, and are the more at home, the more bitterly
they inveigh against Peter.</p>

<p>Now turn to the third interpretation, that of the Latin
Fathers. They admit both that it was Peter and that
it was a real dissension, but they are as anxious as
the Greek to defend Peter's dignity. Thus Tertullian:<a name="FNanchor_30_318" id="FNanchor_30_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_318" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
"If Peter was blamed&mdash;certainly it was a fault of <i>conduct</i>,
not of <i>preaching</i>." And Cyprian:<a name="FNanchor_31_319" id="FNanchor_31_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_319" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> "not even Peter,
whom first the Lord chose, and upon whom He built
His Church, when afterwards Paul disagreed with him
respecting circumcision, claimed aught proudly, or assumed
aught arrogantly to himself, saying that he held
the Primacy, and that obedience rather was due to him by
those younger and later." And Augustine: "Peter himself
received with the piety of a holy and benignant humility
what was with advantage done by Paul in the freedom of
charity. And so he gave to posterity a rarer and a holier
example, that they should not disdain, if perchance they
left the right track, <i>to be corrected even by their youngers</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
than Paul, that even <i>inferiors</i> might confidently venture to
resist <i>superiors</i>, maintaining brotherly charity, in the defence
of evangelical truth. For better as it is on no
occasion to quit the proper path, yet much more wonderful
and praiseworthy is it, willingly to accept correction,
than boldly to correct deviation. Paul then has
the praise of just liberty, and <i>Peter of holy humility</i>:
which, so far as seems to me according to my small
measure, had been a better defence against the calumnies
of Porphyry, than the giving him greater occasion
of finding fault: for it would be a much more stinging
accusation that Christians should with deceit either write
their epistles, or bear the mysteries of their God."<a name="FNanchor_32_320" id="FNanchor_32_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_320" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>Now, to see the<a name="FNanchor_33_321" id="FNanchor_33_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_321" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> fundamental opposition between the
Greek and Latin Fathers, and the reformers, let us observe
that, though there are three ancient interpretations of this
passage, differing from each other, the first denying that
the Cephas so reprehended by Paul, was the chief of the
Apostles, the second affirming this, but reducing the whole
contention to an arrangement of prudence between the
two Apostles, and the third maintaining the reality of the
reprehension, yet all three have in common the reconciling
Peter's chief dignity with the reprehension of him, and the
two latter, besides, are much more careful to admire his
modesty, than Paul's liberty, and make the most of every
point in the narration setting forth Peter's Primacy. On
the other hand the reformers use this reprehension as
their sharpest weapon against his authority, praise Paul's
liberty to the utmost in order to depress that authority,
hunt out everything against Peter, and pass over everything
for him. It is equally evident that their motive in this
runs counter to the faith universal in the Church during
the first four centuries; and that their inference cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>accepted without rejecting all Christian antiquity, and the
very sentiments expressed by Paul himself, as we have
seen, towards Peter.</p>

<p>But as to the reprehension itself, it would seem to have
been not on a point of <i>doctrine</i> at all, but of <i>conduct</i>. S.
Peter had long ago both admitted the Gentiles into the
Church, and declared that they were not bound to the
Jewish law. But out of regard to the feelings of the
circumcised converts, he pursued a line of conduct at
Antioch, which they mistook to mean an approval of their
error, and which needed, therefore, to be publicly cleared
up. Accordingly, Peter's fault, if any there were, amounted
to this, that having, with the best intention, done what was
not forbidden, he had not sufficiently foreseen what others
would thence infer contrary to his own intention. Can this
be esteemed either a dogmatic error, or a proof of his not
holding supreme authority? But the <i>event</i> being injurious,
and contrary to the truth of the Gospel, why should not
Paul admonish Peter concerning it? But very remarkable
it is, that he quotes S. Peter's own example and authority,
opposes the antecedent to the consequent fact, and maintains
Gospel liberty by Peter's own conduct. S. Chrysostome
remarked this. "Observe his prudence. He said
not to him, Thou dost wrong, in living as a Jew, but he
alleges his former mode of living, that the admonition and
the counsel may seem to come not from Paul's mind, but
from the judgment of Peter already expressed. For had
he said, Thou dost wrong to keep the law, Peter's disciples
would have blamed him, but now, hearing that this admonition
and correction came not from Paul's judgment, but
that Peter himself so lived, and held in his mind this belief,
whether they would, or would not, they were obliged to be
quiet."<a name="FNanchor_34_322" id="FNanchor_34_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_322" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

placing S. James first. Now as to this we must remark that some most ancient manuscripts,
and the original Latin version, read "Peter, and James, and John," and that this is
followed by Tertullian, Chrysostome, Ambrose, Ambrosiaster, Augustine, Theodoret, Jerome,
Irenæus, Gregory of Nyssa, and Cassiodorus, of whom Jerome is the more important, in
that he had studied so many ancient commentaries before writing his own. But supposing
that the vulgar reading is the true one, Peter's being once placed by S. Paul between S.
James and S. John will not counterbalance the vast positive evidence for his primacy.
Those who wish to see the probable reasons why S. James was here placed first, may consult
Passaglia, b. 1, c. 14, who treats of the question at length. Perhaps S. Paul, narrating
historically a past incident, recalled them to his recollection <i>in the order of time</i>, in which
they received him: and S. James, residing constantly at Jerusalem, might very probably

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>S. PETER'S PRIMACY INVOLVED IN THE FOURFOLD UNITY
OF CHRIST'S KINGDOM.</h3>


<p>The doctrine<a name="FNanchor_1_323" id="FNanchor_1_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_323" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of S. Paul has brought us to a most
interesting point of the subject, what, namely, is the
principle of unity in the Church. A short consideration
of this will shew us how the office of S. Peter enters into
and forms part of the radical idea of the Church, so that
the moment we profess our belief in one holy Catholic
Church, the belief is likewise involved in that Primacy of
teaching and authority which makes and keeps it one.</p>

<p>The principle of unity, then, is no other than "the Word
made flesh:" that divine Person who has for ever joined
together the Godhead and the Manhood. Thus, S. Paul
speaks to us of God "having made known to us the
mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure,
which He purposed in Himself, in the dispensation of
the fulness of times, <i>to gather together under one head
all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which
are on earth</i>:" at whose resurrection, "He set all things
under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all to the
Church, which is His body, the fulness of Him who
filleth all in all." And again, "the head of every man
is Christ;&mdash;and the head of Christ is God." "And we
being many are one body in Christ, and every one members
one of another:"<a name="FNanchor_2_324" id="FNanchor_2_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_324" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> as, again, he sets forth at length
in the 12th chapter of the First Epistle to the Corinthians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>calling that one body by the very name of
Christ.</p>

<p>With one voice the ancient Fathers<a name="FNanchor_3_325" id="FNanchor_3_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_325" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> exult in this as
the great purpose of His Incarnation. "The work," says
S. Hippolytus,<a name="FNanchor_4_326" id="FNanchor_4_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_326" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> "of His taking a body, is the gathering
up into one head of all things unto Him." "The Word
Man," says S. Irenæus,<a name="FNanchor_5_327" id="FNanchor_5_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_327" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> "gathering all things up into
Himself, that as in super-celestial, and spiritual, and invisible
things, the Word of God is the chief, so also in
visible and corporeal things He may hold the chiefship,
assuming the Primacy to Himself, and joining Himself
as Head to the Church, may draw all things to Himself,
at the fitting time." And again, "The Son of God
was made Man among men, to join the end to the
beginning, that is, man to God;" or, as Tertullian says,<a name="FNanchor_6_328" id="FNanchor_6_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_328" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
"that God might shew that in Himself was the evolution
of the beginning to the end, and the return of the end
to the beginning." And &OElig;cumenius, "Angels and men
were rent asunder; God then joined them, and made
them one through Christ." S. Gregory Thaumaturgus
breaks out, "Thou art He that didst bridge over heaven
and earth by Thy sacred body." And Augustine,<a name="FNanchor_7_329" id="FNanchor_7_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_329" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> "Far
off He was from us, and very far. What, so far off as
the creature and the Creator? What, so far off as God
and man? What, so far off as justice and iniquity? What,
so far off as eternity and mortality? See how far off was
'the Word in the beginning, God with God, by whom all
things were made.' How, then, was He made nigh, that
He might be as we, and we in Him?  'The Word was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>made flesh.'" "Man, being assumed, was taken into the
nature of the Godhead," says S. Hilary:<a name="FNanchor_8_330" id="FNanchor_8_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_330" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and S. Chrysostome,<a name="FNanchor_9_331" id="FNanchor_9_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_331" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
"He puts on flesh, that He who cannot be
held may be holden:" "dwelling with us," says Gregory<a name="FNanchor_10_332" id="FNanchor_10_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_332" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
of Nazianzum, "by interposing His flesh as a veil, that
the incomprehensible may be comprehended." "For
since," adds S. Cyril,<a name="FNanchor_11_333" id="FNanchor_11_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_333" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> "man's nature was not capable
of approaching the pure and unmixed glory of the Godhead,
because of its inherent weakness, for our use the
only-begotten one put on our likeness." "In the assumption
of our nature," says S. Leo,<a name="FNanchor_12_334" id="FNanchor_12_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_334" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> "He became to us the
step, by which through Him we may be able to mount
unto Him:" "the descent of the Creator to the creature
is the advance of believers to things eternal:" and, "it
is not doubtful that man's nature has been taken into
such connection by the Son of God, that, not only in
that Man who is the first-born of all creation, but even
in all His saints, there is one and the same Christ: and
as the Head cannot be divided from the limbs, so neither
the limbs from the Head. For though it belong not to
this life, but to that of eternity, that God be all in all, yet
even now He is the undivided inhabitant of His temple,
which is the Church." For all the above is contained in
our Lord's own words, "that they all may be one, as Thou,
Father, in Me, and I in Thee," on which S. Athanasius<a name="FNanchor_13_335" id="FNanchor_13_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_335" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
says, "that all, being carried by Me, may be all one body
and one spirit, and reach the perfect man:"&mdash;"for, as the
Lord having clothed Himself in a body, became man, so
we men are deified by the Word, being assumed through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>His flesh." S. Gregory,<a name="FNanchor_14_336" id="FNanchor_14_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_336" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> of Nyssa, has unfolded this
idea thus: "since from no other source but from our lump
was the flesh which received God, which, by the resurrection,
was together with the Godhead exalted; just as in
our own body the action of one organ of sense communicates
sympathy to all that which is united with the part,
so, just as if the whole nature (of man) were one living creature,
the resurrection of a part passes throughout the
whole, being communicated from the part to the whole,
according to the nature's continuity and union." And
another,<a name="FNanchor_15_337" id="FNanchor_15_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_337" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> interpreting the words, "that they all may be
one," "thus I will, that they being drawn into unity, may
be blended with each other, and becoming as one body,
may all be in Me, who carry all in that one temple which
I have assumed; the temple, namely, of His Body." And
lastly, S. Hilary<a name="FNanchor_16_338" id="FNanchor_16_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_338" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> deduces this not only from the Incarnation,
but from the Blessed Eucharist. "For, if the Word
be really made flesh, and we really receive the Word as
flesh, in the food of the Lord, how is He not to be thought to
remain in us naturally, since, both in being born a man, He
assumed the nature of our flesh, never to be severed from
Him, and has joined the nature of His flesh to the eternal
nature under the sacrament of the flesh to be communicated
to us."</p>

<p>So deep in the junction of the divine and human natures
in our Lord's adorable Person lies the root of unity for
that humanity which He purchased with His blood. It
is in virtue of this headship that the whole mystical body
is one, and "we all members one of another." By this
headship our Lord nourishes and cherishes the Church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>and communicates to her incessantly that stream of grace
by which she lives. And as this headship flows from the
union of the Godhead and Manhood, so it is inseparable
from His Person, and incommunicable. But He has Himself,
in His parting discourse, recorded by S. John, dwelt
upon the great sacrament of unity, the result of this
headship, and set it forth as the sign and seal of His
own divine mission, and the one convincing proof of His
religion's superhuman origin. By following His words
we shall see that this unity is not simple but fourfold,
and we shall trace the mutual relation and subordination
to the divine Headship of its several kinds.</p>

<p>1. And first, "In<a name="FNanchor_17_339" id="FNanchor_17_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_339" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that day," says He, that is, after His
own resurrection, "ye shall know that I am in My Father,
and you in Me, and I in you," whereby He declares that,
in the completion of the dispensation, the union between
Himself and the faithful shall be such as to image out
the mutual indwelling of the Father and the Son. Which
again is further expressed, "I<a name="FNanchor_18_340" id="FNanchor_18_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_340" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> am the true vine, and
My Father is the husbandman. Every branch in Me
that beareth not fruit He will take away: and every one
that beareth fruit, He will purge it, that it may bring
forth more fruit.... I am the vine; you the branches:
he that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth
much fruit: for without Me you can do nothing. If
any one abide not in Me, he shall be cast forth as a
branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up
and cast him into the fire, and he burneth. If you
abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you shall
ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you."
In these words He sets forth that union of mystical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>influx, by cooperation with which His disciples keep
His words and abide in His love, and of which He is
Himself the immediate principle.</p>

<p>2. But He does not stop at this interior and invisible
union between His disciples and Himself: He speaks
likewise of a new and special command, and of a special
gift, by which their union with each other should be
known. "A<a name="FNanchor_19_341" id="FNanchor_19_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_341" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> new command I give unto you, that you
love one another: as I have loved you, that you also
love one another. By this shall all men know that you
are My disciples, if you have love one to another." And
again, "This<a name="FNanchor_20_342" id="FNanchor_20_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_342" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> is My command, that you love one another,
as I have loved you. Greater love than this hath no
man, that any one lay down his life for his friends.&mdash;These
things I command you, that you love one another."
But the Holy Spirit, whom our Lord was about to send
forth, is the efficient principle of the love here enjoined,
by His substantial indwelling, as we are told, "The<a name="FNanchor_21_343" id="FNanchor_21_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_343" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
charity of God is poured forth in our hearts by the
Holy Ghost who is given to us." From Him, therefore,
bestowed by the Head of the Church, springs that unity
of charity, which, being itself internal, is shown in outward
signs, and constitutes that distinctive spirit of the
Christian people, the spirit characterising it, and analogous
to the national spirit in civil organization.</p>

<p>3. But our Lord likewise speaks of a third unity,
springing from the direction of one and the same divine
Spirit. "And<a name="FNanchor_22_344" id="FNanchor_22_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_344" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> I will ask the Father, and He shall
give you another Paraclete, that He may abide with
you for ever: the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot
receive, because it seeth Him not, nor knoweth Him:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>but you shall know Him, because He shall abide with
you, and shall be in you." "The Paraclete, the Holy
Ghost, whom the Father will send in My name, He
will teach you all things, and bring all things to your
mind whatsoever I shall have said to you." "It<a name="FNanchor_23_345" id="FNanchor_23_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_345" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> is expedient
to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete
will not come to you; but if I go, I will send Him to
you." "But when He, the Spirit of truth, is come, He
will teach you all truth. For He shall not speak of
Himself, but what things soever He shall hear, He shall
speak; and the things that are to come, He shall show
you. He shall glorify Me, because He shall receive of
Mine, and shall show it to you." Of the nature of this
unity we may judge by the gifts and offices assigned
to that Spirit and Paraclete from whom it springs. Now
He is repeatedly termed "the Spirit of truth," and His
office, to <i>suggest</i>, to <i>announce</i>, to <i>teach</i>, and <i>to lead
into all truth</i>. This unity, therefore, is opposed to the
division produced by ignorance and error, and so is the
unity of faith, or Christian profession. Thus our Lord
promises, besides the unity of charity, that of faith, the
efficient principle of which, as well as of the former, is
contained in the communication of the Holy Spirit. But
it is no less true in the supernatural order of divine
gifts, than in the order of nature, that the first cause
produces its effects by means of second causes. And
here, as often as the Lord promises the Spirit of truth,
He promises Him <i>to the Apostles</i>, and assures His perpetual
abidance with them and the successors in their
charge, thus, "That He may abide with you for ever:"
"He shall abide with you, and shall be in you:" "He
shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>mind which I have said unto you:" "Whom I will send
unto you from the Father:" "I will send Him unto you:"
"He shall lead you into all truth:" "He shall show you
the things that are to come." And so the unity of faith
may be expected from its <i>supreme</i> cause, the Holy Spirit
the Paraclete, <i>through the medium</i> of the Apostles and
their legitimate successors: the Holy Spirit in its <i>ultimate</i>,
but they its <i>subordinate</i> principle: He is the <i>source</i>, but
they the <i>channel</i>. Thus to trust to the invisible action
of the Spirit, but to despise the office and direction of the
teachers ordained by Christ, in the very virtue of that
Spirit, is to reject His divine institution, and to risk a
shipwreck of the promised gift of faith and truth.</p>

<p>For in exact accordance with our Lord's words here,
S. Paul has set forth not only the institution, but the source,
as well as the end and purpose, of the whole visible hierarchy.
It is instituted by our Lord, as an act of His divine
headship; its source is in "one and the same Spirit dividing
to every one according as He will;" its end and purpose
is, "the edifying the body of Christ, until we all meet into
the unity of faith."<a name="FNanchor_24_346" id="FNanchor_24_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_346" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Each of these points is important. Our Lord's divine
headship over the Church, all encompassing, as it is, and
the spring of all blessing and unity, does not dispense with
the establishment of a visible hierarchy, but rather is
specially shown therein. And again, the Holy Spirit is the
source and superior principle of all spiritual gifts to all, but
yet He acts <i>through</i> this hierarchy. He is the spirit who
maintains faith and truth, but it is by the instruments of
His own appointing.</p>

<p>Now these three points, the bestowal of all spiritual gifts
and offices by Christ in virtue of His mystical headship, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>Holy Spirit being the one superior principle of such gifts
and offices, and His manifold operation therein through the
visible hierarchy, are set forth most distinctly in two passages
of S. Paul, the twelfth chapter of the First to the
Corinthians, and the fourth chapter to the Ephesians.
"To every one of us is given grace, according to the measure
of the giving of Christ. Wherefore he saith, Ascending
on high He led captivity captive; He gave gifts to men.
Now that He ascended, what is it but because He also descended
first into the lower parts of the earth? He that
descended is the same also that ascended above all the heavens,
that He might fill all things. And He gave some
Apostles, and some prophets, and other some evangelists,
and other some pastors and doctors, for the perfecting of
the saints, unto the work of the ministry, unto the edifying
of the body of Christ, until we all meet into the
unity of faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the
fulness of Christ; that henceforth we be no more children
tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of
doctrine by the wickedness of men, by cunning craftiness
by which they lie in wait to deceive. But doing the
truth in charity, we may in all things grow up in Him
who is the Head, even Christ; from whom the whole
body, being compacted and fitly joined together, by what
every joint supplieth, according to the operation in the
measure of every part, maketh increase of the body, unto
the edifying of itself in charity." "And the manifestation
of the Spirit is given to every man unto profit. To one
indeed by the Spirit is given the word of wisdom; and to
another the word of knowledge, according to the same
Spirit; to another, faith, in the same Spirit; to another,
the grace of healing, in one Spirit; to another, the working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, the
discerning of spirits; to another, divers kinds of tongues;
to another interpretation of speeches. But all these things
one and the same Spirit worketh, dividing to every one according
as He will. For as the body is one, and hath many
members; and all the members of the body, whereas they
are many, yet are one body, so also is Christ. For in one
Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or
Gentiles, whether bond or free, and in one Spirit we have
all been made to drink."<a name="FNanchor_25_347" id="FNanchor_25_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_347" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Thus, then, we have been brought by the words both of
our Lord and of S. Paul, through an inward invisible unity,
that of mystical influx from the vine to its branches, and
again, that of charity, and that of faith and truth, to an
outward and visible unity, one of social organization, called
forth by the great Head for the purpose of exhibiting, defending,
maintaining, and conveying the former, since it is
expressly said that He gave it "for the perfecting of the
saints, unto the work of the ministry, unto the edifying of
the body of Christ," and in order that "we may be no
more children tossed to and fro, and carried about by every
wind of doctrine." And the inward source and cause of
this unity are indeed invisible, being the Holy Spirit of
God, sent down by Christ, when He ascended up on high,
to dwell permanently among men, but its effects are external
and most visible, even the growth of a body "unto a
perfect man, unto the measure of the age of the fulness of
Christ," a body which has an orderly arrangement of all
its parts, and a hierarchy of officers to continue till the end
of all. And the function of this hierarchy is one never to
be superseded, and which none but itself, the organ of the
Holy Spirit, can perform, namely, to bring its members "to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>meet in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the
Son of God." As our Lord says, in the promise, before
His passion, "I will ask the Father, and He shall give you
(the Apostles) another Paraclete, that He may abide with
you for ever, the Spirit of truth," so S. Paul of the accomplishment
after His ascension, "He gave some Apostles and
some prophets, and other some evangelists, and other some
pastors and doctors," yet "all these things worketh one and
the same Spirit." For as the divine Head took to Himself
a body, bridging thereby the worlds of matter and of spirit,
and as "in Him dwelt all the fulness of the Godhead <i>corporally</i>,"
so in His Church, in perfect analogy with the
Archetype, the visible is the channel of the invisible, and
the outward organization is instinct with inward life, and
the hierarchy is the gift of the mystical Head, and the instrument
of the one sanctifying Spirit. To think otherwise,
to disregard the external framework, under a pretence
of exalting the inward spirit, is to undo so far the
work of the Incarnation, and to renew the insanity of
those early heretics who in one way or another would
"dissolve" Christ; for there is no less "one Body," than
there is "one Spirit."</p>

<p>But if His headship of mystical influx is <i>alone</i> and
<i>immediately</i> sufficient, as is so often objected, for the
maintenance of external unity, to what end is the creation
of this visible hierarchy? For the objection that
the invisible headship of Christ renders a visible headship
unnecessary, and indeed an infringement on His sole
divine prerogative, whatever force it may have, tells not
more against an &oelig;cumenical head of the Church, than
against every order and officer of the hierarchy. These
all, and with them the whole system of sacraments as
well as symbols, become alike unnecessary and even injurious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
if each member of the mystical body be knit to
Christ <i>immediately</i> without any outward framework. And
with what face especially can those maintain that the
bishop is the visible head of each diocese, and in being
such does not contradict, but illustrate, the headship of
Christ, who yet deny that there is one in the whole
Church put in the like place over bishops, and see in
such an appointment an infringement on the office of
Christ? Such an argument is so profoundly illogical and
inconsistent, that one has difficulty in believing it to be
seriously held, or is hopeless of bringing conviction to
those who cannot see an absurdity.</p>

<p>Let those, then, who confound together the supreme
Headship of Christ over His Church, whereby He communicates
to it life and grace, with the inferior and
subordinate headship of external unity, see to what their
objection tends. It stops at nothing short of destroying
the whole visible hierarchy, and the sacramental grace
of which it is the channel. Holy Scripture, on the contrary,
tells us in these passages that the providence by
which the Church is governed resembles that by which
this outward universe is ruled, in the subordination of
second causes to the supreme cause. Christ repeats as
Redeemer His work as Creator, to give life and force
to these second causes, and while He works in the members
of His body both "to will and to do," bestows on
them the privilege of cooperating with Him. Thus the
dignity of supreme Head which belongs to Christ, and is
incommunicable, no more takes away the ministry of the
external head who is charged with the office of effecting
and maintaining unity, than it impedes the ministry of
"apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and doctors," to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
whom Christ entrusted the Church, that by their means
it might be brought to sanctity and perfection.</p>

<p>4. And these words bring us to the fourth unity mentioned
by our Lord. For not until "He ascended up on
high" did "He give gifts to men." And this visible hierarchy,
the sign and token of His mystical Headship, and
fostering care, is by Him quickened and informed with
the Holy Spirit, when He is Himself invisible at the right
hand of the majesty of God. This absence, too, is what
He foretold, saying, "And now I am not in the world,
and these are in the world, and I come to thee; Holy
Father, keep them in Thy name whom Thou hast given
Me; that they may be one, as we also are.  While I
was with them, I kept them in Thy name.&mdash;And now I
come to Thee."&mdash;These words of our Lord show that it
was His will that His believers should be no less one
among each other, by an outward and visible union,
than they were one by the internal bond of charity, the
guidance of one Spirit of truth, and the influx of the one
Vine. And so far we have seen that, to guard and maintain
that unity under the guidance of the Spirit of truth,
He called forth the visible hierarchy, in all its degrees.
But what, then, was the external root and efficient principle
of this visible hierarchy, when He was gone to
the Father? Did He not likewise provide for the loss
occasioned by His own absence, which He had foretold?
The argument of S. Paul proves that He did so provide,
as well as His own words.  For S. Paul declares the
Church to be "one Body." Was it then a body without
a head, or a body with a head invisible? Or did the Lord
of all, having with complete wisdom framed His mystical
body in all its parts and proportions, and having set <i>first</i>
Apostles, and then in their various degree, doctors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
pastors, in one single, and that the main point, reverse
the analogy of all His doings? Did He appoint every
officer in His household, except the one who should rule
all? Did He construct the entire arch, save only the
keystone? Did He make a bishop to represent His person,
and be the centre of visible unity in every diocese,
but none to represent that person in the highest degree
and to be the centre of unity to the whole Church? Was
it the end of His whole design "to gather together in one
the children of God, that were dispersed," in order that
there might be "One Fold," and did He fail to add, "One
Shepherd?" Yet S. Paul declares that "there are many
members, but one body." How can the distinct and
diverse members be reduced to the unity of a body,
but by the unity of the head, as the efficient principle?
In accordance with which we may observe that never
is the image of a body used in Scripture to represent
the Church, but it is thereby shown to be visible; and
never is it compared with a body as a type, but that
body is shown complete with its head. Such are the
well-known images of one House, Kingdom, City, Fold,
and Temple, to which we have had so often to appeal.
Even the unity of things in themselves dissimilar is
derived in Scripture from the unity of the Head. Thus
the man and the woman are said in marriage to be one,
and that in a great mystery, representing Christ and the
Church, but this, because "the husband is the head of
the wife." And Christ is said to be one with the faithful,
because "the head of every man is Christ:" and
God one with Christ, because "the head of Christ is
God." If, then,<a name="FNanchor_26_348" id="FNanchor_26_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_348" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the Church is one body, it receives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>according to the reasoning of Holy Scripture, that property
from the unity of its head.</p>

<p>But such a one body, while yet militant upon earth,
S. Paul declares it to be, setting forth at the same time the
various orders of its hierarchy. Is it then a body complete,
or incomplete? With a head or without one? For
it is no reply to say that it has indeed a head, but one invisible.
That invisible headship did not obviate, as we
have seen, the necessity of a visible hierarchy: why then
does it obviate the like and even more striking necessity,
that the hierarchy too must have its visible head? If it
was, so to say, the very first act of our Lord's supreme
headship over all to the Church&mdash;the very token that He
had led captivity captive&mdash;to quicken the visible ministry
which He had established by sending down the Holy Spirit
to abide with it for ever, is the one place most necessary in
that ministry to be the only one left vacant by Him? Is
the one officer most fully representing Himself to be alone
omitted? "The <i>perfecting</i> of the saints" (a metaphor
taken as we have seen, from the exact fitting together of
the stones in a building,) and "the edifying of the body of
Christ," are described as the end to be reached by those to
whom "the work of the ministry" is committed, but as this
applies in a higher degree to the Bishop than to the priest,
so it applies in the highest of all to the Bishop of bishops.</p>

<p>Again, God's method of teaching by symbols, which runs
through the whole Scripture, and the institution of Sacraments,
proves to us His will to lead us on from the visible to
the invisible, and to make the former a channel to the latter.
For "we are all baptized into one body," and the
outward act both images and conveys the inward privilege.
And again in the highest conceivable instance, "because the
head is one, we being many are one body, who all partake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of that one bread."<a name="FNanchor_27_349" id="FNanchor_27_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_349" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In like manner the outward
unity of the Church must accurately represent, and answer
to the inward, which, we know, is derived from the Person
of Christ, who is its head. And so that Person must be
specially represented in the outward unity.</p>

<p>And this is one reason why no unity of a college, whether
of Apostles, or of Bishops, will adequately express that
visible headship of which our Lord's Person is the exemplar.
For the root of all lies in a personal unity, that of
the Godhead and Manhood, and therefore a merely collective
or representative unity cannot express it. And if the
Apostle wrote, "God hath set in the Church <i>first</i> Apostles,"
yet he also wrote that the grand result, "the perfecting of
the saints, and the edifying of the body of Christ," was
due to the ministry, not only of Apostles, but of prophets,
evangelists, pastors, and doctors, each in their degree; they
all conspire to a joint action, which does not impede the
existence of distinct orders in the hierarchy. And his
expression that the Apostles are <i>first</i> in this hierarchy,
without defining their mutual relations to each other, does
not exclude those other passages of Scripture which <i>do</i>
define those relations, and which make Peter among the
Apostles "the first," "the ruler," "the greater," the Judah
among his brethren, the foundation of the whole building,
and the one shepherd in the universal fold. And the more
so because S. Paul uses three expressions of the Church,
two of which are <i>relative</i>, but one <i>absolute</i>. He calls it
"the body of Christ," and "Christ," which are relative;
but he also calls it "one body," which is absolute. Now,
these expressions are not to be severed from each other,
as if each by itself would convey the whole idea of the
Church, which rather is to be drawn from them all together.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>In answer to what the Church is, we must not say
that it is <i>either</i> "the body of Christ," <i>or</i> mystically called
"Christ," <i>or</i> set before us as "one body," for it is <i>all</i> of
these at once, relatively "Christ," and "the body of
Christ," and absolutely "one body."</p>

<p>As, then, the former expressions show that the Church
is one <i>in reference to Christ</i>, so the latter shows that it is
so <i>in itself</i>, and <i>simply</i>. For as the Church is called
"Christ," and "the Body of Christ," because it is one
with Christ by mystical union, drawing its supernatural
life from Christ its head, so it is called "one body," because
in the variety of members and parts, of which it consists,
no one is wanting to its being one body in itself, and to its
being seen to be such. But it would neither be so, nor
seem to be so, if it were without a visible head, the origin
and principle of its inherent visible unity. And so where
the Church is called by S. Paul "one Body," he declares
that it has a visible head.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the inherent notion of the Church, as one
visible body, and the whole dispensation by which visible
things answer to invisible, as their archetypes, demand one
visible head. Now to this <i>inherent</i> necessity let us add the
force of <i>positive</i> teaching. When our Lord in almost His
last words to His Church prays to His Father, "while I
was with them in the world, I kept them in Thy name&mdash;but
now I come to Thee," what does He but suggest the appointment
of another visible head to take that place which He
was leaving? and further, what does He but name one to
that high dignity, when He calls him "the greater" and
"the ruler" among his brethren, commits them to him to
be confirmed by him, and makes him the shepherd of the
whole flock? What else had He done but prepare them for
such a nomination, when He promised <i>one</i> that he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
be the foundation of His Church, and the bearer of the
keys? What else did Christians from the beginning see
in such an one, when they called him the <i>head</i>, the <i>centre</i>,
the <i>fountain</i>, the <i>root</i>, the <i>principle</i> of ecclesiastical
unity?</p>

<p>Let us remark, once more, as a confirmation of the
above, that the archetype of visible unity in the Church,
which our Lord sets before us in His prayer to the Father,
is no other than that most high and solemn of all things
conceivable, the mutual indwelling of the Father and the
Son. "Holy Father, keep them in Thy name whom Thou
hast given Me, that they may be one, as We also are;" and
again, for all successive generations of the faithful, "that
they all may be one, as Thou, Father, art in Me, and
I in Thee, that they also may be one in Us, that the world
may believe that Thou hast sent Me." Now the relation
established by our Lord between Peter and the rest of the
Apostles, by appointing him the visible head of the Church,
and between Peter's successor and all bishops, does represent,
so far as earthly things may, and in a degree which
nothing else on earth reaches to, the mutual relation of the
three divine Persons to each other. For as these are distinct,
but inseparable, so, too, are the Apostles. As the
fulness of the Godhead is <i>first</i> in the Father and <i>then</i> in
the Son and in the Holy Spirit, so the fulness of power
<i>first</i> promised and given to Peter, is <i>then</i> propagated to the
other Apostles united with him. As in the Father the
economy of the divine Persons is summed up under one
head, and gathered into a monarchy, so in Peter is
gathered up the fulness of ecclesiastical power, which,
through union with him, is one in all, as the Church is one,
and the Episcopate one. Moreover, as it is the dignity of
the Father to be the exemplar, principle, root, and fountain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of unity in the Trinity, so is it the dignity of Peter to be the
exemplar, principle, root, and fountain of visible unity in the
kingdom of God, which is the Church. This is alluded to
by Pope Symmachus, thirteen hundred and fifty years ago:
"There is one single priesthood in the different prelates, (of
the Apostolic See) after the example of the Trinity, whose
power is one and indivisible."<a name="FNanchor_28_350" id="FNanchor_28_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_350" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> And long before him
S. Cyprian: "The Lord says, 'I and the Father are one.'
And again it is written of the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit, 'And these three are one.' Is there a man
who believes that this unity, coming from the divine
solidity, cohering by heavenly sacraments, can possibly be
broken in the Church, and torn asunder by the collision of
adverse wills? This unity he who holds not, holds not the
law of God, holds not the faith of the Father and the Son,
holds not the truth unto salvation."<a name="FNanchor_29_351" id="FNanchor_29_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_351" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Whereas, then, all unity in the Body of Christ, the
Church, is derived ultimately from the person of its Head,
the Word Incarnate, that unity is yet four-fold in its
operation, and the efficient principle of one sort is not
to be confounded with that of another. There is the
<i>mystical</i> unity, which consists in the perpetual divine
influx from the great invisible Head to His members;
there is the <i>moral</i> or <i>spiritual</i> unity of charity, consisting
in the presence of the Holy Spirit in the hearts of
believers, and these two are internal, and in closest correspondence.
There are two likewise external, which may
be called the <i>civil</i> or <i>political</i> unity, consisting in the
public profession of the same faith, the same truth, for
what the <i>law</i> is to temporal states, the <i>faith</i> is to the
great spiritual kingdom of Christ; and this unity is
indeed inspired by the Holy Spirit, but is maintained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>by Him through the visible hierarchy; and lastly, correspondent
to the unity of faith, there is the <i>visible</i>
unity of external organization, the immediate or efficient
principle of which lies in the visible headship over the
Church attached by the Lord to S. Peter's chair. The
latter two, while they correspond to each other, are indeed
subordinate to the former, the unity of faith to that of
charity, as the unity of the visible headship to that of
the invisible; yet the very truth of the Body which
the Lord has assumed, and in which He reigns, and
the whole analogy of His dealings with men, and the
sacraments whereby He makes us "partakers of the
divine nature," warn us that it is of the highest importance
for us to see how external unity is the channel
of internal, and the visible the road to the invisible.
No words can be more emphatic to this effect than those
with which the Apostle introduces the description of the
visible hierarchy, and the divine headship which called
it forth. "There is <i>one Body</i> and one Spirit, as you
are called in one hope of your calling. One Lord, one
faith, one baptism. One God and Father of all, who
is above all, and through all, and in us all." From
which he goes on to say, "Ascending up on high, He
gave gifts to men&mdash;some Apostles, and some prophets,
and some evangelists, and some pastors, and teachers."
And lastly, "the Head over all things to the Church,"
is "the Saviour <i>of the Body</i>."<a name="FNanchor_30_352" id="FNanchor_30_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_352" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>But if this be so, we can say nothing more highly to
exalt S. Peter's office in the Church, for he is the great
bond and stay of this outward unity, as even<a name="FNanchor_31_353" id="FNanchor_31_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_353" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> enemies
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>confess. As surely as in a real monarchy the person
of the sovereign ties together every part of the political
edifice, and is endued with majesty because he is at once
the type of God, and concentrates in one the power
and dignity of the whole community, so it is in that
divine structure in which "the manifold wisdom of God"
is disclosed to all creation. The point of strength is
felt alike by friend and foe. On the Rock of Peter has
fallen every storm which the enmity of the evil one
has raised for eighteen hundred years; but yet the gates
of hell have not prevailed against it. In the Rock of
Peter, and the divine promise attached to it, every heart
faithful to God and the Church trusts now, as it trusted
from the beginning. Many temporal monarchs in their
hour of pride have risen against S. Peter's See, but
the greatest of them all<a name="FNanchor_32_354" id="FNanchor_32_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_354" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> declared that no one had ever
gained honour or victory in that conflict, and he lived
to be the most signal instance of his own observation.
"God is patient, because He is eternal," and the Holy See
prevails in its weakness over power, and in its justice over
cupidity, because while temporal dominion passes from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>hand to hand, and stays not with any nation, following
the gift of God which the poet calls fortune,</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">Perchè una gente impera, e l'altra langue,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Seguendo lo giudizio di costei<br /></span>

<p>the visible kingdom of Christ, which is His Church, lasts
for ever, and is built upon the rock of Peter. The long
line of descendants, from Constantine and from Charlemagne,
have in their turn impugned and illustrated this
glorious privilege of the Papal See. What is there so
stable in an empire of commerce, or so solid in the
nicely-balanced and delicate machinery of a constitutional
monarchy, as to exempt them from the action of an universal
law, or to ensure their victory in the doomed contest
with the Vicar of Christ? Mightier things than they have
done their worst, have oppressed, triumphed, and become
extinct, and if it be allowed them in the crisis of their trial
to crucify Christ afresh, He will yet reign from the cross,
and "draw all men unto Him."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

least as curious as the admission. His words are, "Cyprian and the rest cannot have
known the corollaries which follow from their precepts about the Church. For no one is
so dull as not to see that between a certain unity of the universal Church, terminating in
the Roman pontiff, and such a community as we have described out of Irenæus and
Cyprian, there is scarcely so much room as between hall and chamber, or between hand
and fingers. If the <i>innocence</i> of the first ages stood in the way of their anticipating the
snares which ignorantly and unintentionally they were laying against sacred liberty, those
succeeding at least were more sharp-sighted, and it was not long in becoming clear to the
pontiffs what force in establishing their own power and authority such tenets possessed."
So the ancient fathers were not intelligent enough to see that <i>the hand was joined to the
fingers</i>. But the other alternative was still harder to Mosheim, that Lutheranism was
fundamentally heretical and schismatical.</p></div>

<h3>SUMMARY OF PROOF GIVEN FOR S. PETER'S PRIMACY.</h3>


<p>It would now seem to be made clear to all that the
controversy on S. Peter's Primacy relates <i>generally</i> to
the question of inequality in the Apostolic college, and
<i>specially</i> to the question, whether Christ, the Founder
of the Church, set any one of the Apostles, and whom
of them in particular, over the rest. For as, on the one
hand, there would have been no room for the superior
dignity of the Primacy, had all the Apostles been completely
equal, and undistinguished in honour and authority
from each other; so, on the other hand, it is the
nature of the Primacy to be incapable of even being
contemplated, save as fixed on some certain definite subject.</p>

<p>But to determine the two questions, whether the Apostles
stood, or did not stand, on a complete equality, and
whether one of them was superior to the rest in honour
and dignity, it seemed requisite to examine chiefly four
points.</p>

<p>First, the words and the acts of Christ respecting the
Apostles.</p>

<p>Secondly, His expressions which seemed to mark the
institution of a <i>singular</i> authority.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the mode of writing and speaking usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and constantly employed by the Evangelists and other
inspired writers.</p>

<p>Lastly, the history of the Church, from its beginning,
from which might be drawn conjectures, or even certain
proofs, of the power which either all the Apostles had
exercised equally, or one had held above the rest.</p>

<p>For should it become plain, from the agreement of
these four sources, that a certain one of the Apostles,
and that one Simon Peter, had been distinguished from
the rest by the acts and words of Christ, and set over
the Apostles; had been invariably described by the inspired
writers, as the Head and supreme authority; and
in the history of the rising Church, been portrayed in
a way which could only befit the universal ruler, no
difficulty would remain, and there would be arguments
abundant to prove that Christ was the author both of
the inequality among the Apostles, and of Peter's Primacy.</p>

<p>Now we seem to have proved <i>absolutely</i>, what we proposed
<i>hypothetically</i>. For we have shewn that Christ
declared by His whole method of acting, and by solemn
words and deeds, that He did not account Peter as one
of the rest, but as their Leader, Chief, and Head.</p>

<p>We have shown it to have been the will of Christ to concentrate
in Peter the distinctions which belong to Himself,
as Supreme Ruler of the Church. For such must
be deemed the properties of being the Foundation, the
Bearer of the keys, the Holder of universal authority,
the Supporter, and lastly, the Chief Shepherd. Of these
there is no one which He did not promise to Peter singly,
and confer on Peter singly: no one, with which He did not
associate Peter, and Peter only, in making him the foundation
of His Church, bestowing on him the keys, and universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
power of binding and loosing, in setting him over
his brethren to confirm them, and over His fold as universal
Pastor.</p>

<p>We have shown that the Evangelists place almost the
same distinction between the Apostles and Peter, as
between Peter and Christ, while still among us. For
as they set forth Peter as second after Christ, so do
they subject the Apostles to Peter; as the acts and
words of Christ occupy the foreground in respect to
those of Peter, so do his in respect to those of the Apostles;
as Christ, in their histories, is pre-eminent above
Peter, so is Peter more conspicuous than the Apostles; and
as the Gospels cannot be read without seeing in them
Christ as the prototype, so neither can they without seeing
that Peter approaches the nearest to Christ.</p>

<p>We have shown that S. Paul spoke of S. Peter in no
other way than the Evangelists, and that his pre-eminence
is evident in S. Paul's Epistles, as well as in the Gospels.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have shown that Peter shines as the superior
luminary in the history of the rising Church. The
lustre of his deeds in the Acts recalls that of Christ in
the Gospels. In the Gospels Christ is named by far
most frequently; in the Acts no one occurs so often as
Peter. The discourses, the acts, the miracles of Christ
occupy every page of the Gospels; and in that portion
of the Acts which embraces the history of the whole
Church, a very large part has reference to the discourses,
the acts, and the miracles of Peter. In the Gospels,
Christ leads, the Apostles follow; in the Acts, Peter
takes the precedence, the Apostles attend him. In the
Gospels, Christ teaches, and the Apostles, in silence, consent;
in the Acts Peter alone makes speeches, and explains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the doctrine of salvation; the Apostles by their silence
consent. In the Gospels, Christ provides for the Apostolic
college, guards it from injury, defends it when
attacked; in the Acts, Peter provides for filling up the
place of Judas, determines the conditions of eligibility,
enjoins the election, and defends the Apostles before
people, rulers, and chief priests, in quality of their
head.</p>

<p>Moreover, he alone is pre-eminent in exercising the
triple power of <i>authoritative Teacher, Judge, and Legislator</i>.
<i>Of authoritative Teacher</i>, not only towards Jews
and Gentiles, whom he is the first to join to Christ, so
that the same person who was the Church's rock and
foundation, also became its chief architect; but towards
the Apostles likewise, who are taught by his ministry,
that the time was come for the blessing of redemption
to be extended no less to Gentiles than to Jews, and
that the burden of legal rites could not be laid on the
Gentile converts without tempting God. <i>Of Judge</i>,
because, while the Apostles are silent, he is the first to
hear the causes of the faithful, to erect a tribunal, to
examine the accused, to issue sentence, and to support
and confirm it by inflicting excommunication. Of <i>Head
and Supreme Legislator</i>, both when he singly visits
Christians in all parts, and provides for their needs, or
when he uses the prerogative of first voting, and draws
with authority the wording of the law to which the rest
are to give an unanimous consent.</p>

<p>From this compendious enumeration we draw a multifold
proof, both of inequality in the Apostolic college,
and of Peter's superiority at once in rank and in real
government.</p>

<p>I. For, <i>first</i>, a college cannot be considered equal, out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of which Christ chose one, Simon Peter, whom, by His
words and His actions, He showed to be set over all.
Now Christ's whole course of speaking and acting, of
which the Gospels give us the picture, tends to exhibit
Peter as chosen out from the rest, and set over them.
Accordingly, neither is the college of the Apostles equal,
nor can Peter be accounted as one of the rest.</p>

<p>II.  Again, one who has received all in common with the
rest, but much besides peculiar to himself, special and distinguishing,
must seem to be taken out of the common
number. Now such must Peter have been among the
Apostles, since Christ granted nothing to them which He
denied to Peter, but did grant to Peter many most distinguishing
gifts which He gave not to the rest.</p>

<p>III.  And, further, it is apparent that the Foundation and
the Superstructure, the Bearer of the keys, and those who
inhabit the house or city whose keys he bears, the Confirmer,
and those whom he is to confirm, the universal
Pastor and the sheep committed to his charge, cannot be
comprehended under the same order and rank. Now the
distinctions expressed by the terms Foundation, Bearer of
the keys, Confirmer, and universal Pastor, are Peter's official
insignia in reference to, and over, the Apostles themselves.
His distinction from them, therefore, and the inequality
of the apostolic college, are plain.</p>

<p>Perhaps this may be put somewhat otherwise even more
clearly. And so, IV. Let it first be considered, what is plain
in itself, that a distinction carrying pre-eminence depends
on distinction in perfection and gifts, and follows in a
greater or less degree from the greater or less inequality
of these, or in case of their parity exists not at all. Next,
be what we hold both of reason and of faith remembered,
that "every best gift and every perfect gift, is from above,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
coming down from the Father of lights," that God is the
fountain head of all good, and that all gifts whatsoever flow
over from Him to His creatures. From both points it follows
that the amount of the creature's dignity and perfection
lies in the participation of divine goods, and is greater
or less in proportion to the participation and association
with divine goods. So, then, the controversy on Peter's
Primacy and the inequality of the Apostolic college, comes
ultimately to this: <i>whether Christ, the God-man, associated
Peter singly, above all, with Himself, in the possession
of those properties on account of which He stands
Himself related to the Church as its supreme Ruler</i>. For
let it be once evident that Christ did so, and it will of necessity
be evident also, not only that Peter was preferred to
all, but wherein his leadership and headship consisted.
And since we have made the inquiry, there is abundant evidence
to prove that Christ really did associate Peter singly
in five properties, which, belonging to Himself <i>primarily</i>
and <i>chiefly</i>, contain the special cause for which He is the
Prince and Supreme Head of the Church.</p>

<p>For, in truth, it is specially due to the properties and
distinctions of <i>Foundation, Bearer of the keys, Establisher,
Chief Shepherd</i>, and <i>Lord</i>, who has received all
authority from the Father, that the Church has an entire
dependence on Christ, is subject to Him, and that He
enjoys over the Church the right and authority of Supreme
Lord and Ruler. But which of these properties
did He not choose to communicate to Peter, according to
the degree in which they were communicable? He bestowed
them all upon Peter, and upon Peter alone, so
that Peter also is termed <i>the Foundation, the Bearer
of the keys, the Confirmer, the universal Pastor</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
<i>the</i><a name="FNanchor_1_355" id="FNanchor_1_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_355" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> <i>Chief of the whole Church</i>. We see, therefore,
a remarkable proof of Peter being distinguished from
the rest of the Apostles, and set over them, in his singular
and special association with these gifts.</p>

<p>Again, V., to this tends that disposition of divine wisdom
which provides that Peter holds in the Church, and
among the Apostles, a rank of dignity greatly resembling
that which Abraham among the Patriarchs, and
Judah among his brethren, received from God. The
former of these relations has been exhibited, and shown
not to be arbitrarily conceived, but grounded on due
proof. The latter will be presently farther touched
upon. Now who shall deny Abraham that superiority
whereby he was made the Father and Teacher of all
the faithful, or strip Judah of the dignity in which he
excelled his brethren, and was in many points preferred
to them? As little may any one strip Peter of his
authority as supreme teacher, and take from him those
singular endowments, which make him "the greater one"
among his brethren the Apostles.</p>

<p>Especially as, VI., this authority of Peter is clearly
confirmed by the mode of writing usual to the Evangelists.
For it is monstrous and preposterous to confound
with the rest one whom the Evangelists constantly distinguish
and prefer to all. For what more could they
do to show their purpose to distinguish Peter, select him
from the rest, and place him at all times before all the
Apostles? We may venture to say that they omitted
nothing to this end. And so it is absurd to doubt of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>Peter's prerogatives, or set him on the same footing with
the rest.</p>

<p>For, indeed, VII., no one would endure it to be denied,
from the usual mode of writing of the Evangelists, that
Christ was pre-eminent among the Apostles as their
Supreme Head, and was removed from them in dignity
by an infinite interval. Now though the Evangelists do
not give Peter all things, nor in the same degree, yet
they do give him much, and in a degree not dissimilar,
to distinguish him from the rest, showing him, as in a
nearer relation to Christ, so proportionally exalted above
the other Apostles.</p>

<p>And this proof, VIII., is the more persuasive because
S. Paul follows the very same mode of speaking as the
Evangelists. For in repeatedly mentioning S. Peter in
his epistles, he always gives him the place of honour,
and joins him as near as may be with Christ. Who
then can doubt that Peter held a certain pre-eminent
rank?</p>

<p>And the more, IX., because what is read in the Acts,
and the view of primitive history therein contained, looks
the same way, and seems set forth with the same purpose.
For if you compare together the Acts and the Gospels,
the mind at once suggests that the position of Prototype
which Christ holds in the Gospels, belongs to Peter in
the Acts, and that Peter seems distinguished above the
rest of the Apostles in the Acts, as Christ is pre-eminent
far above all in the Gospels. Now what is the
result of so apparent a likeness? What is it fair to
deduce from such a bearing in the Evangelical and Apostolical
history? Those who are obedient to reasoning,
and follow the bright torch of the Scriptures, must confess
with us that in this parallelism of both histories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and so of Christ and Peter, is contained a mark and
sign, proving that Peter follows next after Christ in
dignity and authority.</p>

<p>In authority, X., I repeat, and, therefore, that kind
of superiority which very far surpasses the limits of precedence
and order. For what are the grounds on which
we see Peter's eminence in the Acts, or a resemblance
between the Acts, when speaking of Peter, and the Gospels
when speaking of Christ? Chiefly these, that Peter
is set forth as remarkable, singly, above all, for the use
and exercise of the triple power, of Judge, Legislator, and
authoritative Teacher. Now, the superiority herein asserted,
not merely distinguishes Peter from the rest, but
attaches to him a greater authority over the rest.</p>

<p>XI. And, indeed, propose an hypothesis which is necessary
to solve a complex and undoubted series of facts:
is such an hypothesis thereby made a certainty. At least
these are the principles of philosophy, from which the
laws of reasoning will not allow us to depart. Now,
Peter's pre-eminence and supremacy are such an hypothesis,
without which you can render no sufficient cause
of the facts narrated in the first twelve chapters of the
Acts. Accordingly, this supremacy of Peter may be
considered as proved.</p>

<p>XII. Or to put the argument somewhat differently,
thus: As the existence of causes is deduced, <i>à posteriori</i>,
from effects, so it is perfectly established, <i>à priori</i>, whenever
the series and sum of effects, of which the senses are
cognisant, are foretold from it with certainty. We deduce
the force of gravity necessarily from its effects, à posteriori,
but we likewise determine it to exist, with a judgment no
less invariable, à priori, when it is such that we do not
merely guess at, but certainly anticipate, its sensible effects.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
Now Peter's supremacy is not inaptly compared with this
very force of gravity. For it is a characteristic of each to
be, in its proper order of things, the source and principle
in which effects are involved, which afterwards become
apparent, whether in this physical universe, or in the
supernatural region of the Church.</p>

<p>Suppose, then, Peter to have held the dignity which we
claim for him. What happens in the Acts which might
not, nay, which should not, have been anticipated? Is it
his being mentioned above all, his speaking in the name of
all, his constantly taking the lead, and his eminence, as if
he were the head? But it could not be otherwise if he
alone received from Christ a higher dignity than all the
rest. Is it his discharging the office of supreme Judge, Legislator,
Teacher, and Doctor? Is not this just what was to
be expected from the rank of Head and universal Pastor?
The Primacy, then, the larger authority, and the unshared
majesty of Peter, belong to that class of truths which are
indubitably believed on the strength of deduction, and
rational anticipation.</p>

<p>Having noted, if not all, at least the greater number of
those arguments which we have alleged hitherto in favour
of our cause, we approach the question which was secondly
to be cleared up, what, namely, is <i>the force and nature of
that Primacy</i>, which the same arguments prove to belong
to Peter. For I know that all Protestants are possessed
with the notion that no other pre-eminence should be
ascribed to Peter, on scriptural authority, than one limited
to a certain precedency of honour and order. That <i>precedency</i>
should be granted Peter they are not unwilling to
admit, but <i>supremacy</i>, they stoutly maintain, must not and
cannot be allowed him. As to which their opinion I consider,
that it would be much the shorter way to strip Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
utterly of every prerogative, than to attenuate the distinctions
applied to him in Scripture to a sort of shadowy
precedency. I consider that nothing is so foreign to truth
and the Scriptures, as on their testimony to allow that
Peter was distinguished from the rest of the Apostles,
but to confine that superiority within the very narrow
bounds of honour and order.</p>

<p>For, <i>first</i>, whence do we most evidently and chiefly draw
the greater dignity which Peter clearly possessed above
the others? We draw it from the endowments separately
bestowed upon him, whereby he became the Foundation of
the Church, the Supreme Bearer of the keys, the Confirmer
of his brethren, and the universal Pastor. But
are these names, images, signs, expressing a naked superiority
of honour and order, or rather designating an
authority of jurisdiction and power? I cannot hesitate to
assert either that these forms are most fitted of all to
express a singular authority, or that none such exist in
language. For, <i>secondly</i>, their force is to ascribe to Peter
the main sway, and to mark him as set for the head and
leader of all. Who that hears them can, without perverting
the natural force of words, or disregarding the laws
of interpretation, imagine anything merely honorary, or
figure to himself Peter with a mere grant of precedency?</p>

<p>Especially as, <i>thirdly</i>, he is named in Scripture not only
<i>the First</i>, but, comparatively, the <i>Greater</i>, and absolutely,
the <i>Superior</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_356" id="FNanchor_2_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_356" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Now these terms do, of themselves, and
far more if you consider the context of the discourse in
which they occur, express a singular authority, and one
without rival. An authority, <i>fourthly</i>, kindred to that
with which Christ, while yet in His mortal life, presided
over the Apostolic college, and administered as supreme
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>Head, the company which He had formed. For we can
never sufficiently urge a point which, being in itself most
true, is of itself abundantly sufficient completely to set at
rest the present controversy. It is this, that Peter's
Primacy proceeds from a singular association with those
distinctions, in virtue of which Christ is considered the
Head and Chief, and Supreme Ruler of the Church. So
that the more his Primacy is depressed, the more Christ's
prerogatives and dignity are lowered; nor can he be confined
to a precedency of honour and order, without Christ's
superiority being shut within well nigh the same limits.</p>

<p>Besides, <i>fifthly</i>, are tokens wanting in Scripture which
disclose the nature of Peter's Primacy? Are there not
effects which unfold the force and quality of the cause
from which they spring? Such tokens there are in abundance,
and such effects manifold. These are, the care
with which Peter guarded the Apostolic college; the authority
with which he visited Christians in every part; the
singular exercise of judicial power, by which he established
Church discipline, and provided for its maintenance; his
acts of authoritative teaching; his drawing the form of
laws which were to rule the universal Church; and, in
short, the wonderful regard with which that Church followed
Peter as its Head, and the Steward of all the Lord's
family. What Primacy is it which these tokens set forth?
What cause which these effects demonstrate? Is it one
limited to a precedency of honour and order? or one
pre-eminent by an inherent jurisdiction and authority? It
is a point which needs no further words. For if any there
be whose minds are not struck by a candid and sincere
exposition of facts, you will in vain attempt to persuade
them by arguments.</p>

<p>Unless, indeed, <i>sixthly</i>, they allow themselves to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
forced out of their prejudice by the Scriptures exhibiting
such a Primacy of Peter as compels all others to profess
one and the same faith with him, and to maintain one and
the same society. For such an obligation could proceed
neither from titles of honour, nor from precedency. It
demanded a stronger cause&mdash;none other, in fact, but that
supreme authority by which Peter is made head of all.</p>

<p>But we shall feel much more at home in the truth of
this deduction, if we enquire a little more deeply into the
reasons for selecting one among the rest, namely Peter,
and instituting the Primacy. For the purpose, and end
proposed in a work, have the force of a <i>negative</i> rule by
which we may judge with certainty what ought to be done,
or could not be left undone. I know well that it does not
follow, if anything has been instituted for a certain purpose,
that it ought to be endowed <i>only</i> with those properties
which appear necessary for the end to be gained;
for it may be much more munificently established than the
absolute need required. But at the same time I know that
there would be a failure in prudence and wisdom in one
who, desiring a certain work for a specific end, did not
provide it with everything that could be deemed necessary.
Thus the <i>knowledge of the intention and purpose</i> is equivalent,
if not to a <i>positive</i> rule, determining all and singular
the powers bestowed on any institution, at least to a <i>negative</i>,
ascertaining what must be given to it, and what cannot
be denied to it.</p>

<p>Now is the purpose for which Christ instituted the
Primacy, and honoured Peter with its dignity, unknown,
or is it most truly ascertained? The end which moved
Christ to make the college of Apostles unequal, and to
set Peter as head over it, is it secret, or very conspicuous?
There are in all three <i>classes of reasons</i> which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
enable us to form, not a mere guess, but an ascertained
judgment, as to the purpose of Christ in instituting the
Primacy. There are <i>typical</i> reasons, drawn from previous
shadowings forth of it: there are <i>analogical</i>, derived
from relations of resemblance; and there are <i>real</i>,
inherent in the testimonies themselves, and the Church's
endowments. Let us briefly exhibit these in order.</p>

<p>I. By, then, that signal agreement wherewith the two
dispensations, the old and the new, correspond to each
other, the first in outline, and the last as filled up, this
rudimental, and that complete, we are plainly instructed
that it was Christ's purpose for Peter, in the new dispensation,
to bear the character, whose lineaments had
been traced before in Abraham, and to be eminent
among the Apostles, for the prerogative which Abraham
had possessed among the Patriarchs. Now Abraham's
special prerogative, and pre-eminence, was this,
that no one could share either promise, whether carnal
or spiritual, which is expressed in Scripture, by "the
Blessing," who was not joined with Abraham by a double,
that is, a carnal and spiritual, a physical and moral,
bond. For to him and to his seed were the promises made,
with the condition, that only by conjunction with him,
and with his seed, they could flow over to the rest.
Since, then, in the new dispensation, Peter was to sustain
the character of Abraham in the old, and since the
only-begotten Son of the Father, having put on the form
of a servant, granted to Peter the prerogative which,
in prelude of His future order, He had given to Abraham,
it is plain that Simon was chosen, honoured with the
name of Cephas, and preferred above all, in order that
from him as supreme minister of Christ, and by union
with him as visible head, all the members of the Church's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
body might enjoy the blessings and fruits of the Christian
institution.</p>

<p>The deductions from this are easy to see. For two
things chiefly follow, specially declarative of the nature
of the Primacy, and shewing its intent, to be the cause
and efficient principle of that unity by which the Church
of Christ is one visible body. First, there follows the
<i>duty</i> laid upon all the faithful, of being joined with
Peter, if they would not fall from those promises with
which Christ has most bountifully enriched His mystical
Body, being no other than that which reverences
Peter as its visible head. Secondly, there follows Peter's
<i>jurisdiction</i>, in virtue of which he enjoins all to form
one communion and society with him, as well as effects,
defends, and maintains it. Now, nothing can be stronger
than this ordinance of Christ, either to prove a Primacy
of supreme jurisdiction, or to unfold its purpose of effecting
and maintaining unity.</p>

<p>The same is the bearing of another type no less remarkable,
and no less adopted to explain the whole matter.
For, as Israel, "according to the flesh," was the shadow
of the "Israel of God," which was "according to promise:"<a name="FNanchor_3_357" id="FNanchor_3_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_357" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
and as the kingdom of Israel was a type and
ensample of the kingdom of heaven, the approach of
which Christ proclaimed in these words, "The time is
fulfilled, and the kingdom of heaven is at hand:" so the
twelve sons of Israel, the heads of the Israelitish race,
represented and imaged out those Twelve whom Christ
chose, made princes in His Church, and endowed with
supreme authority to build up that Church's structure,
and enrich it day by day with new accessions of
spiritual children. Of this type our Lord's words are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>the strongest guarantee: "Amen, I say unto you, that
you who have followed Me, in the regeneration, when
the Son of Man shall sit on the throne of His Majesty,
you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve
tribes of Israel." And, again, in the very discourse where
He sets forth the future Superior, "I dispose to you, as
My Father disposed to Me, a kingdom; that you may eat
and drink at My table, in My kingdom; and may sit upon
thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_4_358" id="FNanchor_4_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_358" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>But now, though all the sons of Israel in the former
typical kingdom were chiefs, and heads of tribes, yet one
of them, that is Judah, had a special prerogative, which the
Scriptures set forth, and which was called the <i>right of the
first-born</i>. In virtue of this, on the one hand, Judah was
esteemed the Lord of his brethren, whom they were to
reverence as the parent of the whole family, and on the
other, it was only by union with him, and with the seed
that was to spring from him, that the other chiefs could
promise to themselves the divine blessing. And so the
tribe of Judah had a great pre-eminence over the other
eleven. It was its prerogative to take the<a name="FNanchor_5_359" id="FNanchor_5_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_359" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> lead: it had
received from God the promise of an[6] authority which
was not to terminate before the old covenant should be
transformed into the new: from it was the seed<a name="FNanchor_6_360" id="FNanchor_6_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_360" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to be
expected, which should be the source of blessing to all
nations, prefigured as they were by the twelve tribes;
the other tribes were bound<a name="FNanchor_7_361" id="FNanchor_7_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_361" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> to union with it, and to
the profession of its religion, on pain of falling into
schism, and forfeiting the divine covenant. All this was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>expressed by Jacob in prophetic inspiration, when he
addressed Judah as the head and root of his line: "Judah
(praise) art thou, thy brethren shall praise thee: thy hand
is on the neck of thine enemies: the sons of thy father
shall bow down to thee." It remains, then, to ask, who
was to represent Judah's person in the new kingdom, and
on whom Christ bestowed the prerogative, the type and
image of which had gone before in Judah. It is most
plain that this was Simon Peter, for whom we have, therefore,
to claim a double prerogative, the one of being the
source and origin, from which no one may be separated
without severance from the kingdom and promises of
Christ: the other of being the first-born, as betokening
excellence, by which he was pre-eminent in the possession
of special rights among his brethren, the Apostles.</p>

<p>The former prerogative was expressed by the Fathers
of Aquileia, when, in the words of S. Ambrose, they
stated their belief in S. Peter's chair, "For thence, as
from a fountain head, the rights of venerable communion
flow unto<a name="FNanchor_8_362" id="FNanchor_8_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_362" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> all." The latter is confirmed and illustrated
by the solemn expressions so often recurring in Christian
records, wherein Peter is called, "<a name="FNanchor_9_363" id="FNanchor_9_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_363" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>the Bishop of
Bishops," "<a name="FNanchor_10_364" id="FNanchor_10_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_364" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>the Pastor of Pastors," "<a name="FNanchor_11_365" id="FNanchor_11_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_365" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>first prelate of
the Apostles," "<a name="FNanchor_12_366" id="FNanchor_12_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_366" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>Patriarch of the whole world," "<a name="FNanchor_13_367" id="FNanchor_13_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_367" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>universal
bishop," "[14]father of fathers," "[14]having the
dignity of pastoral headship," "<a name="FNanchor_14_368" id="FNanchor_14_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_368" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>the most divine head
of all heads, arch-pastor of the Church."</p>

<p>II. To these reasons, which, as we think, may be called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span><i>typical</i>, succeed the <i>analogical</i>, which prove with equal
evidence the purpose of the Primacy as instituted, and
its inherent powers. If we ask what are these reasons
from analogy, and to what they point, one only answer
can be given commended by any show of truth, that
the Primacy was instituted in order that the Church of
Christ might seem to be moulded after the analogy of
one human body, one house, one kingdom, one city,
and one fold. But whence the need that so very remarkable
and clear an analogy should be obtained by
the institution of the Primacy? Doubtless because the
Primacy was created as a principle, by whose virtue and
efficiency what was various and manifold should be gathered
up into unity, because it was to be a head in which
all the diverse members of the ecclesiastical body should
be joined, the centre of the Church's circle.</p>

<p>Therefore the reasons drawn from analogy show that
the unity of the Church is to be considered the special
end for which the Primacy was instituted, and the Primacy
itself a principle abundantly provided with all
those means by which so admirable a blessing as unity
may be first produced and then maintained.</p>

<p>And this is confirmed by another analogy, well worthy
of close attention. This consists in the double and reciprocal
relation in which the universal Church stands to
particular Churches, and the institution of the Primacy
to the institution of bishops, who, by Christ's appointment,
govern those particular Churches: an agreement
which ought to have especial force with those who believe
in the divine institution of bishops. For as the whole
society of true believers, and the particular congregations
of which it is made up, are called in Holy Scripture
and the Christian records by one and the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
name of the Church, so is there the very closest analogy
between the bond which connects the universal Church
and that which connects its several parts.</p>

<p>Exactly, then, as it is asserted with great truth of all
these particular Churches that they are one house, one
city, and one fold, so must this be repeated of the
whole Church, since it is set forth in Scripture by no
other images, and has no less right to claim the property
of unity. Hence S.<a name="FNanchor_15_369" id="FNanchor_15_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_369" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Chrysostome's golden saying,
"If it is the Church of God, it is united and one, not
at Corinth only, but in the whole world. For <i>the Church</i>
is a name not of division, but of union and harmony;"
and S.<a name="FNanchor_16_370" id="FNanchor_16_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_370" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Gregory calls it, "The tunic without seam,
woven from the top throughout."</p>

<p>Now the same reason which existed for instituting
particular bishops to govern and preserve in unity particular
flocks, moved Christ to institute an universal
Primate, and to set him over the whole fold. If in the
former case the best description of a particular Church
is that of S. Cyprian, "A people united to its priest,
and a flock adhering to its pastor;"<a name="FNanchor_17_371" id="FNanchor_17_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_371" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> in the latter the
<i>form of unity</i>, which Christ established in the universal
Primate, no less imposes on all, both taught and teachers,
the necessity of saying with S. Jerome, "I following none
as the first save Christ, am joined in communion with
your blessedness, that is, with the chair of Peter. Upon
that rock the Church is built, I know. Whoever outside
of this house eateth the lamb, is profane. If any
one was not in the ark of Noah, he shall perish. I
know not Vitalis; I reject Meletius; I am ignorant of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>Paulinus.  Whoever gathers not with thee, scatters:
that is, he who is not of Christ is of Antichrist."<a name="FNanchor_18_372" id="FNanchor_18_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_372" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>III. A great accession of evidence will accrue to what
we have said if we attentively consider the reasons
deduced from the texts containing the institution of the
Primacy, and those proceeding from the inherent properties
of the Church. To speak of the texts first:</p>

<p>1. Either they carry no meaning with them, or they
prove at least this, that Christ, in instituting the Primacy,
intended,<a name="FNanchor_19_373" id="FNanchor_19_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_373" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> while exhibiting the whole Church under the
usual image of a house and building, to give it a <i>foundation</i>,
the bond at once of its strength and unity; and,
again, while communicating to one the special gift of unwavering
faith, to make him the channel for establishing
and<a name="FNanchor_20_374" id="FNanchor_20_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_374" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> <i>confirming</i> all the faithful; to<a name="FNanchor_21_375" id="FNanchor_21_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_375" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> render the fold
which he had gathered out of all nations one by the
unity of a supreme visible <i>pastor</i>, and to<a name="FNanchor_22_376" id="FNanchor_22_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_376" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> constitute in
the Lord's family, amid so manifold a distinction of officers,
one of such eminence as to be <i>the Ruler</i> and <i>the Greater</i>
among all.</p>

<p>But can we, or ought we, to conclude from this as to
the purpose of the Primacy, and as to its constituent
force and principle? Assuredly these texts prove directly
and categorically that the Primacy was set up as
<i>the efficient principle</i>, whereby to mould the Church's
visible unity, and was endowed with all that authority,
without which unity could neither have been produced,
nor maintained in existence.</p>

<p>2. And in this judgment we shall be confirmed if we
investigate the properties of which the Church cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>be deprived, without taking a form and an appearance
different from that which it received from Christ. The
first which occurs is that <i>identity</i> by which the Church
must always be like itself, and cannot be substantially
different at its beginning and in its growth; one thing
when it had Christ for its visible head, and another
when His words had come to pass, "A little while, and
now you shall not see Me&mdash;because I go to the Father."
Now at its first commencement, in the time of our Lord's
mortal life, the Church presented the form of a society
governed by the supreme power of one, and deriving its
visible unity from one supreme visible head. That it
might not subsequently lose this identity, and put on
another form, our Lord chose a Primate to be the principle
of visible unity, and to have the power of a head
over the whole body.</p>

<p>And indeed this was necessary to maintain the double
character and test of<a name="FNanchor_23_377" id="FNanchor_23_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_377" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> <i>unity</i> and<a name="FNanchor_24_378" id="FNanchor_24_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_378" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> <i>Catholicity</i>, by which
the Church is distinguished in Holy Scripture and in
the records of Christian antiquity. As to <i>unity</i>, not
only are the expressions in the creeds, and the more
ample explanation of them in the<a name="FNanchor_25_379" id="FNanchor_25_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_379" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Fathers, most clear
and emphatic, but likewise what is said in the Holy
Scriptures of the <i>end</i> for which the Church was founded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>by Christ. For the<a name="FNanchor_26_380" id="FNanchor_26_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_380" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> grace of God our Saviour hath
appeared to all men, instructing those who had<a name="FNanchor_27_381" id="FNanchor_27_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_381" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> changed
the truth of God into a lie, and liked not to have God
in their knowledge, that<a name="FNanchor_28_382" id="FNanchor_28_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_382" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> denying all these things they
might become an acceptable people, and<a name="FNanchor_29_383" id="FNanchor_29_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_383" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> enlightened
by Christ, and sanctified in the truth, might by the profession
of one faith be<a name="FNanchor_30_384" id="FNanchor_30_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_384" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> one body and one spirit, in the
same<a name="FNanchor_31_385" id="FNanchor_31_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_385" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> manner in which the Father and the Son are
one, and might be<a name="FNanchor_32_386" id="FNanchor_32_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_386" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> divided by no sects and dissensions,
which are manifestly the works of the flesh, not of God,
who is not the<a name="FNanchor_33_387" id="FNanchor_33_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_387" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> God of dissension but of peace. For
therefore<a name="FNanchor_34_388" id="FNanchor_34_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_388" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Christ, the only-begotten of the Father, gave
His blood for it, to present it to Himself, a glorious
Church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing,
which would break peace, and disturb the agreement of
faith; but that it should be holy and without blemish,<a name="FNanchor_35_389" id="FNanchor_35_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_389" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
immovable through that rock on which it rests, and
against which not even the gates of hell shall prevail;
wisely ordered as the<a name="FNanchor_36_390" id="FNanchor_36_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_390" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> house of God, in which<a name="FNanchor_37_391" id="FNanchor_37_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_391" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> all
hear his voice, who is set over as the<a name="FNanchor_38_392" id="FNanchor_38_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_392" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> ruler, and has
received his brethren to be<a name="FNanchor_39_393" id="FNanchor_39_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_393" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> confirmed, and the<a name="FNanchor_40_394" id="FNanchor_40_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_394" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> care
of the whole flock;<a name="FNanchor_41_395" id="FNanchor_41_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_395" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> endued with virtue from on high,
and strengthened by the<a name="FNanchor_42_396" id="FNanchor_42_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_396" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Spirit of truth who proceeds
from the Father; possessing the power of<a name="FNanchor_43_397" id="FNanchor_43_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_397" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> authoritative
teaching, which if any<a name="FNanchor_44_398" id="FNanchor_44_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_398" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> hear not, nor obey, they are to
be accounted as heathens and publicans, by a judgment
which binds both in heaven and on earth. Are there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>any who do not see that in this description, which sets
forth the Church's pre-ordained end, its proper character
and very lineaments, the Primacy itself is included, and
exhibited as the principal cause which effects the unity
of the whole body? I hardly think that any such can
be, so apparent is the bond which ties these several parts
together.</p>

<p>Yet perhaps this may be more vividly brought out if
we shortly mention the common opinions among Protestants
on the Church's unity. For, omitting those who
hold an<a name="FNanchor_45_399" id="FNanchor_45_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_399" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> invisible Church, and so expunge visible unity
from its attributes, all the other opinions may be reduced
to three.</p>

<p>A. Anglicans, whose belief has been set forth, besides
Pearson on the Creed, with more than usual care by
Dodwell, (in his Treatise on the Bishop, as the Principle
of Unity, and S. Peter's Primacy among the Apostles as
the Exemplar of Unity,) begin by noting that the question
of visible unity cannot be determined in the same way as
it respects the universal Church, or each particular Church.
But why? Because, they say, it was indeed the will of
Christ, that each particular Church should have a double
unity, inward and outward, but it was not His will that
the whole Church, the sum of these particular Churches,
should have the same mark and test. Because, it was
His will that both unities should characterise the particular
Churches, to use a school phrase, <i>separately</i> and <i>distributively</i>,
but not the whole body, and the sum of these, taken
<i>collectively</i>. Whence they conclude that Bishops were
chosen and made, by the command of Christ, to preside</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>over particular Churches, and be in them the source and
principle of external unity, but that a Primate was not
chosen, to whom the whole Church should be subject, and
on whom its external unity should depend.</p>

<p>At this argument one is lost in astonishment, how it
could have suggested itself to learned men, and gained
their assent. For what had they to prove, or how could
they assure themselves, or others, as to either of these two
points, that external unity was necessary to particular
Churches, but not to the whole Church, or that the institution
of Bishops, presiding over particular Churches, came
from Christ, but not that of the Primate, whose charge
was to rule, administer, and maintain in unity the whole
Church. Had they texts wherein to trust? But as often
as the Bible speaks of the Church's unity, it means that
Church, which is called "the kingdom of God," "the kingdom
of Christ," and "the kingdom of heaven," which is
termed "the inheritance of the Gentiles," and embraces
with a mother's bosom, and a mother's love, the whole race
of man, from one end of the earth to the other. Had they
creeds to cite? But in these unity is attributed to that
Church only, which is so termed absolutely, and very often
has the epithet of Catholic.</p>

<p>Moreover, is the word Church, in its unrestricted application,
of doubtful meaning? On the contrary, it is
specially defined as well in the Holy Scriptures,<a name="FNanchor_46_400" id="FNanchor_46_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_400" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> where
it expresses of itself the whole society of believers, as in
the Fathers, such as Irenæus,<a name="FNanchor_47_401" id="FNanchor_47_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_401" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Tertullian,<a name="FNanchor_48_402" id="FNanchor_48_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_402" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Clement<a name="FNanchor_49_403" id="FNanchor_49_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_403" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
of Alexandria, Origen,<a name="FNanchor_50_404" id="FNanchor_50_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_404" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>  Hilary,<a name="FNanchor_51_405" id="FNanchor_51_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_405" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Jerome,<a name="FNanchor_52_406" id="FNanchor_52_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_406" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>rest without exception, who, in using it, express the whole
Christian people joined in one sole communion. It is
defined also by Councils, as in the Canons of Laodicea,<a name="FNanchor_53_407" id="FNanchor_53_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_407" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
Carthage,<a name="FNanchor_54_408" id="FNanchor_54_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_408" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> and Constantinople,<a name="FNanchor_55_409" id="FNanchor_55_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_409" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> where the Church means
the whole assembly of orthodox believers, as distinct from
heretics and schismatics. It is defined in the most ancient
explanation of the creeds, the unanimous meaning of which
Tertullian seems to have rendered in saying: "And, therefore,
so many and so great Churches are that first one
from the Apostles, whence all come. So all are first, and
all Apostolical, while all set forth one unity, while they
have interchange of peace, the appellation of brotherhood
and the common rights of friendship, privileges regulated
by no other principle than the tradition of the same sacrament."<a name="FNanchor_56_410" id="FNanchor_56_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_410" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
Lastly, the very heretics<a name="FNanchor_57_411" id="FNanchor_57_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_411" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> defined this term,
who, in order to make themselves understood, could use
the word Church in no other sense than to express the
universal assembly of the faithful.</p>

<p>After this it is not at all necessary to ask Anglicans
afresh if they have ancient Fathers whose authority they
can quote. What these thought and believed about the
Church's unity is fully shown by those whom we have
quoted, and by the words of Irenæus, "The Church, though
dispersed throughout the whole world, yet as if it were
contained in the same house, carefully preserves the rule of
faith, and holds it as if she had one soul and one heart,
nay, and teaches it with one consent, as if she spoke with
one voice. For although different tongues occupy the
world, yet the force of tradition is one and the same, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>do the Churches of Germany, Spain, Gaul, the East,
Egypt, Libya, and the middle of the world, embrace any
other faith. But as there is one and the same sun shining
over the whole world, so the preaching of the truth shines
everywhere, and enlightens all men who desire its knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_58_412" id="FNanchor_58_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_412" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>What, then, was the motive of Anglicans, in maintaining
the unity of particular churches, and the institution
of bishops cohering with it, to be necessary, while they
denied the necessity of unity in the Church universal, or
of a Primate's institution, to effect universal unity? What
induced them to assert incompatibilities, and defend them
as a matter of life and death? The evidence of the
Scriptures, and the unquestionable belief of all Christian
antiquity, extorted from them the acknowledgment that
unity was a mark of the Church, and the ascription to
Christ of the institution of bishops as necessary for the
forming and maintaining unity. <i>But the fixed purpose
of defending their schism, and their determination to
reject the Primacy, urged them to deny that unity in
the whole Church was ordered and provided for by
Christ.</i> The result of these affirmatives and negatives
was a doctrinal<a name="FNanchor_59_413" id="FNanchor_59_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_413" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> monster of incomparable ugliness, an
outrage on the light both of nature and of revelation, as
incapable of defence, as abhorrent from reason and from
grace.</p>

<p>B. The second Protestant opinion has been set forth
at length by<a name="FNanchor_60_414" id="FNanchor_60_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_414" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Vitringa, and supported with all his ingenuity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>It is that of those who distinguish a two-fold
unity of the Church, one interior, spiritual, proceeding
from union with one and the same invisible Head, Jesus
Christ, and completed and perfected by the inhabitation of
the Holy Spirit, and the bestowal of heavenly gifts; the
other exterior, visible, depending on profession of the
same faith, participation of the same sacraments, obedience
to the same superiors. Having made this distinction, they
proceed to argue for the purpose of proving that while
the former unity is universal, and absolutely necessary,
the latter is neither universal nor necessary, save hypothetically,
(of which hypothesis Vitringa nowhere explains
the nature,) and so is capable both of extension and restriction.
In a word, they attach simple and absolute necessity
and universality to the spiritual and invisible unity, but by
no means to the external and visible.</p>

<p>But for this what are their authorities? Can they
allege the most ancient Fathers in unbroken succession
from the Apostles? Nay, they candidly confess that the
Fathers thought external and visible unity simply and
absolutely necessary, and not those only of the fourth and
fifth century, but those of the second and third. Witness
Vitringa,<a name="FNanchor_61_415" id="FNanchor_61_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_415" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> who says, "If we consult on this point the
doctors of the ancient Christian Church, they seem on all
hands to have embraced the view that the communion of
believers in holy rites, in the supper of the Lord, and in
reciprocal offices of brotherly love, was maintained absolutely,
not hypothetically. They supposed, and seem to
have persuaded themselves, that all who were joined to
the Christian Church by the due rite of baptism after
previous preparation, were really regenerated by the grace
of the Holy Spirit, and so that the Christian Church was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>an assembly of men, who in far greater part, saving hypocrites,
of whom a few might exist in secret, participated in
the renewing and sanctifying grace of the Holy Spirit.
Accordingly, to be joined to the Church was much the
same as being joined to the heavenly city. To have one's
name on the Church's books, much the same as to have
it in God's book of life. On the other hand, to be severed
from Church communion, or to use Tertullian's words, "to
be deprived of the sacrament of the Body and Blood of
the Lord, and to be debarred from all brotherly communion,"
was to risk salvation, and incur the danger of eternal
death. That is, they supposed that no one was saved
out of the external communion of the Church, which
they confounded with the mystical and spiritual communion
of the Saints. And again, kindred points to
these, and resting on the same principle, that bishops
represent the office and person of Jesus Christ Himself
in the Christian Church; that those who separated
themselves from them when rightly and duly elected,
separated themselves at the same time from the communion
of Christ Himself. That those who were absolved by the
bishops after penance publicly performed according to the
canons of ecclesiastical discipline, restored to their rank,
and honoured with the kiss of peace, were absolved in the
heavenly court by God Himself, and Christ the Judge.
Lastly, which was the most<a name="FNanchor_62_416" id="FNanchor_62_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_416" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> <i>audacious</i> of all such hypotheses,
that it was all over with the salvation of all who
separated themselves in schism from the external communion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>of the Church and its rites, although hitherto they
had neither been tainted with heresy, nor involved in
crimes destructive of the Christian<a name="FNanchor_63_417" id="FNanchor_63_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_417" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> profession. It would
be easy for me to support at length each one of these particulars
by the sentiments and the discipline of the doctors
of the primitive Church, were they unknown to the more
instructed, or did my purpose allow it. I now only appeal
to Cyprian's letter to Magnus, in the whole of which He
supposes and urges the very hypotheses which I have been
enumerating; and amongst the rest, speaking of Novatian's
schism, he writes thus distinctly: "But if there is one
Church, which is beloved by Christ, and alone is cleansed
in His laver, how can he who is not in the Church," (that
is, in communion with that particular external assembly
which makes a part of the external Catholic Church,)
"be loved by Christ, or washed and cleansed in His laver?
Wherefore as the Church alone possesses the water of life,
and the power of baptizing and washing a man, let him
who asserts that any one can be baptized and sanctified
with Novatian, first show and teach that Novatian is in the
Church, or <a name="FNanchor_64_418" id="FNanchor_64_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_418" class="fnanchor">[64]</a><i>presides over the Church</i>. For the Church
is one, which, being one, cannot be at once within
and without. For if it is with Novatian, it was not
with Cornelius. But if it was with Cornelius, who succeeded
the Bishop Fabian in regular order, and whom
the Lord hath glorified with martyrdom over and above
the rank of his high priesthood, Novatian is not in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>Church."<a name="FNanchor_65_419" id="FNanchor_65_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_419" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> It is the precise thing which we have been
stating."</p>

<p>But where did Vitringa and the supporters of his doctrine
get courage to contradict the whole line of Fathers
and their unbroken tradition? You would surely expect
from them decisive arguments, and expressions from Holy
Writ distinctly laying down no other than a <i>hypothetical</i>
necessity of visible and external unity. But you may
search in vain all over the Gospels, the Epistles, and the
Acts, for any such. Not only is there no mention in them
of such a distinction as that invisible unity is absolutely
necessary, while external and visible unity is but hypothetically
so, but this latter is plainly enjoined and set forth
as the note which the mystical body of Christ, the true
Church, cannot be without; and its violation is reckoned
among those works of the flesh which exclude from the
kingdom of God.</p>

<p>How, besides, can that be deemed necessary only under
hypothesis, without holding and faithfully maintaining
which you cut yourself off from the very fountain of
blessing, and transgress and subvert the order appointed
by God for attaining salvation? Such an assertion
would be senseless. Yet in most of the Protestant confessions,&mdash;the
Helvetic, art. xiv., the Galliean, art. xvi., the
Scotch, art. xxvii., the Belgian, art. xxviii., the Saxon,
art. xii., the Bohemian, art. viii., and that of the Remonstrants,
art. xxii.,&mdash;it is laid down as an indisputable
principle, "That the heirs of eternal life are only to be
found in the assembly of those called." What then do
those who violate outward and visible unity, and withdraw
from the outward and visible body of the Church?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>They stop up the very way which Providence has opened
for their obtaining "the inheritance of sons."</p>

<p>For indeed Christ is the Saviour, but of His mystical
body, which<a name="FNanchor_66_420" id="FNanchor_66_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_420" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> is the Church, which therefore He purchased
with His own blood, joined to Himself by that
closest bond of being His spouse, enriched with promises,<a name="FNanchor_67_421" id="FNanchor_67_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_421" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
provided with all manner of graces, and most nobly
dowered with<a name="FNanchor_68_422" id="FNanchor_68_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_422" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> truth, charity, and the Holy Spirit, to
give her at last salvation, and<a name="FNanchor_69_423" id="FNanchor_69_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_423" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>"the weight of eternal
glory." But have these things reference to a visible or
an invisible Church? To a Church one and coherent,
or rent and torn by factions? It is the Church which
Christ founded, which He made to be<a name="FNanchor_70_424" id="FNanchor_70_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_424" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> "the light of the
world," bound together by<a name="FNanchor_71_425" id="FNanchor_71_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_425" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> manifold external links,
ordered to be one with the unity of a house, a family,
a city, a kingdom; with that unity wherewith the Father
and the Son are one; in which He placed<a name="FNanchor_72_426" id="FNanchor_72_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_426" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> pastors and
doctors to bind and to loose, and to watch over the
agreement of all the parts; which He founded upon
Peter, committed in chief to Peter to rule and to feed
it. Such, then, as fall off from one single visible Church
are of the condition of those whom the Apostles of the
Lord foretold, that "in the last time there should come
mockers, walking according to their own desires in ungodlinesses:
these are they who separate themselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>sensual men, having not the<a name="FNanchor_73_427" id="FNanchor_73_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_427" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Spirit:" these tear themselves
from their Saviour, lose the fruit purchased by
His blood, and fall from the inheritance which the Head
obtained for His body and His members.</p>

<p>Therefore the necessity of union with the one single
visible Church is as great as the necessity of union with
Christ the Head, as the necessity of the remission of
sins, "for<a name="FNanchor_74_428" id="FNanchor_74_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_428" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> outside of it they are not remitted: for this
Church has specially received the Holy Spirit in earnest,
without whom no sins are remitted:" as the necessity of
charity, "<a name="FNanchor_75_429" id="FNanchor_75_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_429" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>for it is this very charity which those who
are cut off from the communion of the Catholic Church
do not possess," whence "<a name="FNanchor_76_430" id="FNanchor_76_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_430" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>whatsoever thing heretics
and schismatics receive, the charity which covers a multitude
of sins is the gift of Catholic unity and peace:"
as great, in fine, as the necessity not to involve oneself
"in<a name="FNanchor_77_431" id="FNanchor_77_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_431" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> a horrible crime and sacrilege," "in<a name="FNanchor_78_432" id="FNanchor_78_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_432" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> the greatest
of evils," one "by<a name="FNanchor_79_433" id="FNanchor_79_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_433" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> which Christ's passion is rendered
of no effect, and His body is rent," by which<a name="FNanchor_80_434" id="FNanchor_80_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_434" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> the sin
is committed of which Christ said, "It shall not be forgiven,
neither in this world nor in the world to come:"
by which one is estranged "from the sole Catholic Church,
which retains the true worship, in which is the fountain
of truth, the home of faith, the temple of God, into
which if any one enter not, or from which if any one
go out, he loses the hope of life and eternal salvation.
Let no one flatter himself in the spirit of obstinate contention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>for life is at issue, and salvation, which without
care and caution will be forfeited."<a name="FNanchor_81_435" id="FNanchor_81_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_435" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> Can any necessity
be greater, or less conditional than this? Or what can
be more plain than this statement of the simple and
absolute necessity of visible unity and outward communion?</p>

<p>Where then are we to find the cause which induced
so many learned and able Protestants first to imagine
this distinction between the necessity of internal and external
communion and unity, and then to deceive themselves
and others with such a mockery? The real cause
was, as I believe, that having denied the institution of
the Primacy, and the authority lodged in it for the purpose
of forming and maintaining unity, they were without
a criterion or proof, in virtue of which, among so
many Christian societies divided from and condemning
each other, they could safely choose the one with which
they were to be joined in communion, and the outward
unity of duty and obedience. For they would readily conclude
that the unity so often commended in Scripture, and
so earnestly enjoined, could not be external, since God, who
does not command impossibilities, had instituted no visible
sign to mark that company of Christians, which alone
among all the rest was the continuation and development
of the Church founded by Christ, and built up by the
Apostles.</p>

<p>C. From the same source must the third Protestant
doctrine on unity be derived. <a name="FNanchor_82_436" id="FNanchor_82_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_436" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>Jurien filled up the
sketch of this, which <a name="FNanchor_83_437" id="FNanchor_83_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_437" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>Casaubon, <a name="FNanchor_84_438" id="FNanchor_84_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_438" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>Claude, and <a name="FNanchor_85_439" id="FNanchor_85_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_439" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>Mestrezat
had drawn, and it became so popular as not only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>to infect a large number of Protestants, but to exert a
withering influence on certain unstable members of the
Catholic body. It teaches that we must believe not only
in an internal and spiritual, but in a visible and external
unity, for the Scriptures plainly urge its necessity, and
Christian tradition fully describes it, so that there is
not a truth more patent or established on greater authority;
but this unity is restricted within narrow bounds,
and confined to the articles called fundamental, though
as to how many these are no one defender of the system
is agreed with another. For it is sufficient for Christians
not to differ in the profession of such articles for them
to be deemed members of one and the same Church.
Whence they infer that one and the same true Church
is made up out of almost all Christian societies, the
Roman, the Greek, the Nestorian, the Eutychian, the
Waldensian, the Lutheran, the Anglican, and the Calvinist,
for their differences, important as they are, offer
no hindrance to the unity which Christ enjoined, the
Apostles preached, the creeds express, and universal tradition
demands.</p>

<p>As Bossuet,<a name="FNanchor_86_440" id="FNanchor_86_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_440" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> the brothers Walemburg,<a name="FNanchor_87_441" id="FNanchor_87_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_441" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Nicole,<a name="FNanchor_88_442" id="FNanchor_88_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_442" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and
even some Protestants have most fully dealt with this
portentous opinion, there is no need to urge much against
it here. I prefer repeating the question, what <i>occasion</i>
the Protestants had to get up so unheard-of a paradox,
and a system so absurd? It was twofold: one theoretical,
and the other practical.</p>

<p>The theoretical was this. The crime of heresy, depicted
in Scripture, and Christian antiquity, with colours so dark,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>had gradually lost its foulness and its magnitude in the
minds of Protestants, who had, at length, come to the
pass of reckoning religious, as well as civil, liberty, among
the unquestionable rights of man. As if, all other human
acts being subject to a law, those alone which proceed from
the intellect are exempt: as if the difference between
right and wrong, which embraces the whole range of man's
life, did not relate to its noblest part, in the acts of the
intellect and the reason: as if God had laid down a law
of justice, charity, fortitude, and prudence, but entirely
omitted a <i>law<a name="FNanchor_89_443" id="FNanchor_89_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_443" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> of faith</i>: as if the will submitted to a
law of <i>good</i>, but the mind owned no law of <i>truth</i>: or as if
God cared for the boughs and leaves, but took no thought
of the root.<a name="FNanchor_90_444" id="FNanchor_90_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_444" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> But what could Protestants do? Having
allowed to all full license of thought, and overthrown the
authority which ruled the mind, they were forced, while
they kept the <i>name</i> of heresy, to give up the <i>thing</i> meant
by it, and the effects springing from that thing: they were
forced to attenuate to the utmost the crime of heresy, and
to reduce to the smallest possible number the articles
necessary to be believed by all; they were forced to extend
beyond all measure the Church's limits, while they
contracted beyond all measure the range of necessary
unity.</p>

<p>Besides the theoretical, there was a practical occasion
in those schisms which, not merely in later or in mediæval
times, but in the first ages also, rent the Christian society.
Jurien and Pfaff appeal to these, pretentiously enumerating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>those which arose under Popes Victor, Cornelius,
Stephen, Urban VI., and Clement VII., and those named
from Donatus, Meletius, and Acacius. Then they ask
if the true Church of Christ can be thought to consist in
one single society perfectly at union with itself. They
allege many conjectures against this, but dwell on the
argument, that <i>in defect of a visible external test</i>, such
an assertion could not be maintained without <i>imposing
upon all a most intolerable burden of searching out
where is the true doctrine and the legitimate ministerial
succession</i>: for it is not until those are found, that, at
length, that one single society will be recognised, with
which, as the only true Church, unity of Communion is
to be kept.</p>

<p>Now, I profess that I do not see how this argument
can be met, if the institution of the Primacy, and its
proper function to form and maintain unity, be rejected.
For, without this, by what visible token among so many
Christian societies, divided by intestine dissension, and
condemning each other, can you distinguish the one which
has the character of the true Church, and the right to
exact communion with itself? There is none to be
found; and so, either all hope of finding the true Church
must be relinquished, or an enquiry must be undertaken
into purity of doctrine, and legitimate ministerial succession,
on the termination of which the only true Church
will at last be found. But as this latter course is to by
far the greater number of men impossible, dangerous<a name="FNanchor_91_445" id="FNanchor_91_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_445" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> to
all without exception, and most foreign to the Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>temper, the only conclusion remaining, is, that the selection
of a Primacy with the power of effecting unity impressed
upon it, <i>is most intimately involved and bound up
in the visibility and unity of the true Church</i>.</p>

<p>And quite as closely is it bound up with that other
test of the Church, its Catholicism. We are not to believe
Voss and King,<a name="FNanchor_92_446" id="FNanchor_92_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_446" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> in their assertion that this test began to
be applied first in the fourth century, for the purpose of
distinguishing the genuine company of the orthodox, and
the true body of Christ, from heretics and schismatics.
For we find the Church distinguished by the epithet of
Catholic, not merely in the records of the fourth<a name="FNanchor_93_447" id="FNanchor_93_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_447" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and
fifth<a name="FNanchor_94_448" id="FNanchor_94_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_448" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> century, but in those of the third,<a name="FNanchor_95_449" id="FNanchor_95_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_449" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> and the
second,<a name="FNanchor_96_450" id="FNanchor_96_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_450" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> at the beginning of which S. Ignatius wrote,
"Follow all of you the bishop, as Jesus Christ the Father;
and the body of presbyters, as Apostles. But reverence
deacons, as the command of Christ. Without the bishop
let nothing of what concerns the Church be done by any
one. Let that be deemed a proper Eucharist which is
under the bishop, or with his sanction. Where the
bishop is, there also let the multitude be; as, where Christ
Jesus is, <i>there is the Catholic Church</i>."<a name="FNanchor_97_451" id="FNanchor_97_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_451" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> As, therefore,
that cannot be the Church of Christ, which is not Catholic,
we ought to investigate the meaning which is given to
this word by the consent of all orthodox believers.</p>

<p>Now, two points are signified in it, one of which is its
<i>material</i>, the other its <i>formal</i>, or <i>essential</i>, part. Its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span><i>material</i> part is, that the geographical extension of the
true Church be such that its mass be <i>morally</i><a name="FNanchor_98_452" id="FNanchor_98_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_452" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> universal,
<i>absolutely</i> great, and eminently visible, but <i>comparatively</i>
with all heretical and schismatical sects, larger
and more numerous. Of this <i>material</i> meaning attached
to the epithet, Catholic, we find abundant witnesses in all<a name="FNanchor_99_453" id="FNanchor_99_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_453" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
the orthodox writers who defended the cause of the Church
against the Donatists, and again, against the Luciferians,<a name="FNanchor_100_454" id="FNanchor_100_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_454" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
and Novatians; and likewise, in those who have explained
the creeds,<a name="FNanchor_101_455" id="FNanchor_101_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_455" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> and, as occasion offered, have touched on
the force of the term Catholic.<a name="FNanchor_102_456" id="FNanchor_102_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_456" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> But the same first cited
witnesses tell us that universal diffusion is not sufficient,
and that we require another element to infuse a soul into
this universally extended body, and to bring it to unity.</p>

<p>For two properties are continually recurring in Christian
records, one of which may be called <i>negative</i>, the
other <i>affirmative</i>. The force of the former is to <i>expel
from the circle of the one true Catholic Church all sects
of heretics and Schismatics</i>: of the latter, that this
Church <i>consist in one single communion and society,
whose members cohere together by hierarchical subordination</i>.</p>

<p>But is it true that both these points are so plainly and
constantly inculcated? To remove all doubt we will quote
the authors who most distinctly assert the one and the
other. As to the first, there are <a name="FNanchor_103_457" id="FNanchor_103_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_457" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>Clement of Alexandria,

agree in asserting that <i>there is one only ancient Catholic
Church</i>, outside of which the divine patience endures and
bears with heresies, which are as thorns. Thus in language
ecclesiastical and Christian nothing can be considered as
more certainly proved than that the epithet of Catholic is
<i>distinctive</i>, and shows the communion which rejects from
its bosom all heresies and all schisms. It was with great
reason, therefore, that<a name="FNanchor_113_467" id="FNanchor_113_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_467" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>Pacian wrote what<a name="FNanchor_114_468" id="FNanchor_114_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_468" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>Cyril of
Jerusalem, and<a name="FNanchor_115_469" id="FNanchor_115_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_469" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>Augustine very frequently repeated,
"Our people is divided from the heretical name by this
appellation, that it is called Catholic."</p>

<p>Moreover this unity, which we have said may be called
<i>negative</i>, is necessary indeed to the understanding of the
Church as Catholic, but is by no means sufficient to complete
the idea of Catholicity. To it therefore must be
added the <i>affirmative</i> unity, by which Catholicism is not
only divided from heretics and schismatics, but becomes in
itself a coherent body with members and articulations. It
is to the assertion and maintenance of this unity, which is
the soul of Catholicity, and without which it cannot even
be conceived, that has reference what we so often read in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>the monuments of antiquity about the <a name="FNanchor_116_470" id="FNanchor_116_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_470" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>necessity of communion
among the members of the Church and the <a name="FNanchor_117_471" id="FNanchor_117_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_471" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>tokens
and means of that communion. There are very
distinct and innumerable testimonies about it in the ancient
Fathers,<a name="FNanchor_118_472" id="FNanchor_118_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_472" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> declaring its <i>necessity</i>, and setting forth its
<i>mode</i> of composition and coherence.</p>

<p>For to set forth the <i>mode</i> of this is the plain drift of
what <a name="FNanchor_119_473" id="FNanchor_119_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_473" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>Irenæus writes in confutation of heretics by the tradition
of the Apostolical churches: "For since it would be
very long in the compass of our present work to enumerate
the successions of all the Churches, taking that Church
which is the greatest, the most ancient, and well known to
all, founded and established at Rome by the two most
glorious Apostles, Peter and Paul, by indicating that tradition
which it has from the Apostles, and the faith which
it announces to men, which has reached even to us by the
succession of bishops, we confound all those, who, in whatsoever
manner, either through self-pleasing, or vain glory,
or blindness and evil intention, <a name="FNanchor_120_474" id="FNanchor_120_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_474" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>gather otherwise than
they ought. <i>For</i> to this church on account of its superior
chiefship, it is necessary that every Church should come<a name="FNanchor_121_475" id="FNanchor_121_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_475" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
together, that is, the faithful who are everywhere; for
in this Church the tradition which is from the Apostles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>has been ever preserved by those who are everywhere.
...By this ordination and succession, the tradition and
preaching of the truth, which is from the Apostles in the
Church, has reached down to us. And this proof is most
complete, that it is one and the same vivifying faith,
which has been preserved, and handed down in truth, in
the Church from the Apostles to the present day."</p>

<p>The churches, therefore, which are everywhere diffused,
derive that strength and harmony of parts, out of which
the whole body of the Catholic Church is made up, from
the fact of their agreeing in the unity of faith and preaching
with that Church of Peter, which is the greatest, the
chief, and the more powerful. It follows that the Primacy
of Peter, and the authority inherent in it to effect unity, is
that principle which Christ selected, that the Church which
He had set up might be Catholic, and bear the note of
Catholicity on its brow.</p>

<p>And Cyprian would set forth the same <i>mode</i> of communion,
when he speaks of the <i>coherence of bishops</i>, by
which both the <i>Catholic episcopate</i> is made <i>one, and the
Church one and Catholic</i>. For as the <i>several communities
draw the unity of the body from the unity of the
prelates</i> to whom they are subject; so all prelates, and the
communities subject to them, constitute <i>one Catholic episcopate
and one Catholic Church</i>, because they cohere with
the <i>principal</i> church, <i>the root and matrix</i>, which is the
Church of Peter, <i>upon whom</i> the Lord founded the whole
building, and whom He instituted <i>to be the fountain and
source of Catholic unity</i>.<a name="FNanchor_122_476" id="FNanchor_122_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_476" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>These words are a clue to understand <a name="FNanchor_123_477" id="FNanchor_123_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_477" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>Tertullian's
meaning, when, already become a Montanist, he called
the Catholic Church, whose discipline he was attacking,
<i>the Church near to Peter</i>&mdash;"Concerning your opinion,
I now enquire whence you claim this right to the Church.
If because the Lord said to Peter, 'Upon this rock I will
build My Church,' 'to thee will I give the keys of the
kingdom of heaven,' or 'whatsoever thou shalt bind or loose
on earth, shall be bound or loosed in heaven,' you, therefore,
pretend that the power of binding and loosing is
derived to you, that is, to all the Church near to Peter;
how do you overthrow and change the manifest intention
of the Lord in conferring this on Peter<a name="FNanchor_124_478" id="FNanchor_124_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_478" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> <i>personally</i>,
'Upon thee I will build My Church,' and 'I will
give to thee the keys,' not to the Church, and 'whatsoever
thou bindest or loosest,' not what they bind or
loose." Now he used this mode of speaking because it
was customary with Catholics, who were wont to exhibit
<i>nearness with Peter</i> as the characteristic of the Church,
and the necessary condition for sharing that power, whose
plenitude and native source Christ had lodged in Peter.</p>

<p>This certain and undoubting judgment of Catholics,
Tertullian himself, before his error, had clearly expressed
in his book, De Scorpiace, c. x., where he says, "For
if you yet think the heaven shut, remember that the
Lord here (Matt. xvi. 19) left its keys to Peter, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span><i>through him to the Church</i>." Nearness, then, with
Peter, and <a name="FNanchor_125_479" id="FNanchor_125_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_479" class="fnanchor">[125]</a><i>consanguinity of doctrine</i> thence proceeding,
are no less necessary to the Church, that it may be
the Catholic Church which Christ founded and built
upon Peter, than that it be partaker in those gifts which,
again, He Himself granted only to unity, as it is effected
in Peter and by Peter.</p>

<p>Now not only the most ancient Fathers, as Irenæus,
Tertullian, and Cyprian, but the whole body of them,
assign the origin of this to Peter. This they make the
vivifying principle of agreement, society and unity, without
which the Church can neither be intrinsically Catholic,
nor the mind conceive it as such. It is so stated
by <a name="FNanchor_126_480" id="FNanchor_126_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_480" class="fnanchor">[126]</a>Pacian, <a name="FNanchor_127_481" id="FNanchor_127_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_481" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>Ambrose, the <a name="FNanchor_128_482" id="FNanchor_128_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_482" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>Fathers of Aquileia, <a name="FNanchor_129_483" id="FNanchor_129_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_483" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>

Gelasius, <a name="FNanchor_134_488" id="FNanchor_134_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_488" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>Hormisdas, <a name="FNanchor_135_489" id="FNanchor_135_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_489" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>Agatho, <a name="FNanchor_136_490" id="FNanchor_136_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_490" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>Maximus Martyr,
and, to shorten the list, by Leo<a name="FNanchor_137_491" id="FNanchor_137_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_491" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> the Great. It is in
setting forth the unity of the Catholic episcopate that he
writes what ought never to be forgotten by Christian
minds: "For the compactness of our unity cannot remain
firm, unless the bond of charity weld us into an inseparable
whole, because, as we have many members in one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>body, and all members have not the same office, so we,
being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members
one of another. For it is the connection of the
whole body which makes one soundness and one beauty;
and this connexion, as it requires unanimity in the whole
body, so especially demands concord among bishops. For
though these have a like dignity, yet have they not an
equal jurisdiction; since even among the most blessed
Apostles, as there was a likeness of honour, so was there
a certain distinction of power, and the election of all
being equal, pre-eminence over the rest was given to
one, from which mould, or type, the distinction also between
bishops has arisen, and it was provided by a
great ordering, that all should not claim to themselves
all things, but that in every province there should be
one whose sentence should be considered the first among
his brethren; and others again, seated in the greater
cities, should undertake a larger care, through whom
the direction of the universal Church should converge
to the one See of Peter, and nothing anywhere disagree
from its head."</p>

<p>And, if I do not deceive myself, the direct drift of all
this is to answer the question, whether the doctrine of
Peter's Primacy, and its virtue, as the constituent of
unity and Catholicity, is contained in the most solemn
standard of faith, the creed. For although there are
unimpeachable testimonies to prove that the creeds were
not published and explained to Catechumens, in order
to convey to them a full and complete Christian instruction;
and though it be proved further to have been the
purpose of the Church's ancient teachers to omit many
points in the creeds which were to be set before the
initiated at a more suitable season afterwards, it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
nevertheless be said that the most commonly received
articles of the creed may be regarded as so many most
fruitful germs, from which the remaining doctrines would
spontaneously spring. And so, to keep within our present
point, what is more plain than that the sum of
doctrine concerning Peter's Primacy, contained in the
Bible, illustrated by the Fathers, and defined by Councils,
is involved in that article of the creed in which we
profess that the Church is one and Catholic? No doubt
there nowhere occurs in the creeds, <i>expressed in so many
words</i>, mention of Peter, or of the Primacy bestowed on
him, or of hierarchical subordination; yet it is most distinctly
stated that the Church is one and Catholic. What
meaning, then, were the faithful to give to those epithets?
What were they to intend in the words, I believe one
Catholic Church? What but the meaning of the words
themselves, which they received from the Church's teachers
together with the creeds? But they could not form the
conception of one Church and that Catholic, without
thinking likewise of one Catholic <i>principle</i> of the Church;
nor could they assign the dignity of that one Catholic
principle to any other but Peter, whom alone they had
invariably been taught to have been set over all. For
what S.<a name="FNanchor_138_492" id="FNanchor_138_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_492" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Bernard wrote in mediæval times, "For this
purpose the solicitude of all Churches rests on that
one Apostolic See, that all may be united under it and
in it, and it may be careful in behalf of all to preserve
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace," must be
considered nothing but a repetition of the faith which
resounded through the whole world, from the very beginning
of the Christian religion.</p>

<p>Unless, therefore, any can be found who prefer asserting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span><i>either</i> that true believers <i>never</i> understood what they
believed, in professing the Church to be one and Catholic,
<i>or</i> that they understood this <i>otherwise</i> than it had
been universally and constantly explained by the Church's
teachers; it must be admitted, that faith in Peter's Primacy,
and in the power bestowed upon it for the purpose
of making the visible kingdom of Christ one and Catholic,
is coeval with that profession of the creeds which sets forth
the Church as one and as Catholic.<a name="FNanchor_139_493" id="FNanchor_139_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_493" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<h3>THE NATURE, MULTIPLICITY, AND FORCE OF PROOF FOR
S. PETER'S PRIMACY.</h3>

<p><a name="FNanchor_1_494" id="FNanchor_1_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_494" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>As the natural end of all proof is to give assurance,
every kind of it must be considered a mean to persuade and
determine the mind. Not but that there are different
kinds, and that in great variety. If we refer these to
their respective topics, some are <i>internal</i> and <i>artificial</i>,
others <i>external</i> and <i>inartificial</i>; some belong to the philosopher,
others to the theologian, the former having their
source in nature, the latter in revelation; another sort,
again, rests on <i>witnesses</i>, and another on <i>documents</i>. But if
we consider their persuasive force, they may be conveniently
ranged under the two classes of <i>probable</i>, and <i>certain</i>
or <i>demonstrative</i>.</p>

<p>But if it be asked what sort of proof we have hitherto
used, and drawn out to the best of our ability, we must
distinguish between the <i>principal</i> and prevailing proof,
and this in form is inartificial, theological, and drawn from
the inspired documents; and the proofs <i>occasionally inserted</i>
and confirmatory of the principal: these, it will be
evident, are sometimes artificial and internal, such as those
drawn from analogy, and the harmonious coherence of
doctrines, from the unity and Catholicity of the Church,
and the institution of bishops to rule particular flocks;
and sometimes derived from witnesses, for such we may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>deem the ancient Fathers, whose importance and force, as
testimonies, no prudent mind will reject. To embrace,
then, the full extent of our proof, it ranges over all forms
and modes, is artificial and inartificial, and rests not only
on documents, but on witnesses. Now two things follow
from this mixed and manifold character of our proof, of
too great importance to be passed over in silence.</p>

<p>The first of these is, the standard and criterion of resistance
which our proof presents to opponents. For consisting,
as it does, of so many elements, confirmed, as it is,
by the absolute harmony of so many various parts, that
only can be a satisfactory answer, which meets at once
every particular proof, and the whole sum of it. For it
would be to small purpose to give another sense, with some
speciousness, to one or two points, if the great mass of
matter and argument remain untouched. The only valid
answer would be <i>to reject and deny the Primacy of supreme
authority, presenting at the same time a sufficient
cause for all those results of which the proof consists</i>.
For so long as the institution of the Primacy is necessary
to supply a sufficient cause for these results, so long the
force of our proof remains untouched, and the institution
of the Primacy unquestionable. We can therefore demand
of our opponents this alternative, either to acquiesce in our
proof, or, rejecting the Primacy, to find, and when they
have found to establish, an hypothesis equal to the explanation
of all that is contained in our arguments artificial
and inartificial, in our documents and our witnesses.</p>

<p>The second point is one which all will admit. The proof
we have given is such that <i>unless</i> it be deceptive, the institution
of the Primacy is demonstrated to be not only
<i>true</i>, but also <i>revealed</i>, not only <i>tenable</i>, but matter of
<i>faith</i>. For although we have interwoven testimonies and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
artificial arguments, this was to confirm what was already
demonstrated, and to shed fresh light on what was already
clear; but the <i>proper</i> source from which we have drawn
our proofs, was the documents of the Holy Scriptures
themselves. Now what is thence drawn is <a name="FNanchor_2_495" id="FNanchor_2_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_495" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>revealed, and
enters into the number of things which, being revealed, are
matter of <i>faith</i>.</p>

<p>These two points are clear, but a third may be
somewhat less so.  Many will ask, what <i>is</i> the force of
the proof, its power to persuade, and whether it carry
complete certitude, or be defective. Now to this we shall
reply, that the proof which we have presented is not only
probable, but altogether decisive. It wants nothing to produce
the fullest assurance. This is a subject which I have
judged fit for special and separate investigation, as due both
to myself, my readers, and the cause which I am defending.
For it is not a happiness of our nature to catch the
whole and the pure truth at a single glance. This requires
repeated acts of the mind; we have to make the effort
again and again, and only terminate our examination
when we have submitted our supposed discovery to reiterated
reflection. Thus it is that truth comes out in full
light, imposition is detected, the line drawn between doubt
and certainty, and every point located in its due place.
This enquiry, then, into the proof itself I consider due not
only to myself and my readers, but to a cause, which requires
the utmost attention as being of the highest importance,
and the source of the deepest dissensions; for it is
not too much to say that the origin of all those divisions
which we see and lament in the Christian name, may be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>referred to the reception or the denial of this doctrine
concerning the Primacy.</p>

<p>Now we shall best reach the subject by first considering
the inherent force of the proof <i>in itself</i>, and <i>absolutely</i>,
and then <i>comparatively</i> with those arguments to which
the most distinguished Protestant sects ascribe a full and
complete demonstrative power.</p>

<p>I. First, then, as to the force of proof <i>absolutely</i>. We
must reflect that two conditions complete a proof derived
from documents; <i>first</i>, the authenticity of the document;
<i>secondly</i>, either the immediate and unquestionable evidence
of the testimonies quoted from it, or their meaning being
rendered certain by argument. If these two conspire, nothing
is wanting to produce assurance. Now, as to the
documents, whence our proof is derived, no Christian doubts
their authenticity; and as to the testimonies drawn from
them, part<a name="FNanchor_3_496" id="FNanchor_3_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_496" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> belong to a class of such evidence as to admit of
no doubt; and part,<a name="FNanchor_4_497" id="FNanchor_4_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_497" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> being equally clear, and marked in
themselves, have had to be defended from false interpretations.
Accordingly, our proof is peremptory in both
particulars.</p>

<p>Moreover, our proof was not restricted to one or two
passages of holy Scripture, but extended over a great
series, all tending to support and consolidate the argument.
We have set forth, not a naked institution of the
Primacy, but multifold foreshadowings and promises of it,
its daily operation and notoriety. From its first anticipation
we went on to its progressively clearer expression,
its promise, its institution, its exercise, and the everywhere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>diffused knowledge of it in the primitive Church.
So far, then, as I see, nothing more can, with reason, be
asked, to remove all doubt as to Peter's prerogative of
Primacy; for, when the bestowal of certain privileges can
be proved by documents, all question as to their existence
is terminated. But here we find in documents, not their
bestowal merely, but antecedents and consequences, a
beginning, a progress, and a manifold explanation, which
stand to the Primacy as signs to the thing signified.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the demonstration which we have given of
the Primacy, considered <i>in itself</i>, and <i>absolutely</i>, needs
nothing to challenge assent.</p>

<p>For, suppose it disputed whether Cæsar surpassed the
other Roman Senators in honour and power. Could it
be proved by undoubted records, that he so conducted
himself as gradually to smooth his path to the supreme
power; that he next gained from the senate and Roman
people, the title of Emperor and Prince; that he exercised
these powers at home and abroad, and received universal
testimony to the dignity he had acquired; in such case the
judgment would be unanimous that he was emperor, and
head of the Roman Senators. Now, substitute Peter for
Cæsar, the Apostles for the Senators; Christ, the Evangelists,
Luke and Paul, for the senate and people; and you
will see all the proofs enumerated for Cæsar, to square
exactly with Peter. For we learn from Scripture <i>the steps</i>
by which he rose to the Primacy, <i>the time</i> when he received
it, <i>how</i> he exercised it, and the lucid testimonies
to it which he received from Christ, the Evangelists,
the Apostolic Church, and Paul. Accordingly, his Primacy
and supreme authority among the Apostles rests
on a proof which gives complete assurance, and challenges
assent. It is a consequence deduced, not from a single, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
from manifold inference; not merely drawn from results,
but foreseen in its causes; declared not merely in the
words of institution, but in the very acts of its exercise;
supported not only by sundry texts, but by a cloud of
conspiring witnesses; proved by an interpretation, not
obscure, and far-fetched, but clear and obvious. A thing
of such a nature it is folly to deny and temerity to
doubt.</p>

<p>But, further, reflect on the other arguments which
come in collaterally to support that from the Holy Scriptures.
Then it will be found that our proof consists in
the harmonious concurrence of these four sources, 1. <i>the
authentic scriptural documents</i> distinctly setting forth
the promises, the bestowal, the exercise, and the everywhere
diffused knowledge of the Primacy: 2. <i>witnesses</i>
the most ancient, well nigh coeval with the Apostles, of
great number, renowned for their holiness, or their martyrdom,
excellent in learning, far removed from each
other in situation, faithful maintainers of the Apostolic
teaching, who, with one mouth, acknowledge the Primacy:
3. <i>the analogy of doctrines</i>, for the Church, which
we profess to be one, and Catholic, can neither exist,
nor even be conceived as such, without the Primacy: 4. <i>the
facts of Christian history</i>, which are so entwined with
the institution of the Primacy, that they cannot be even
contemplated without it. For there are no less than
fourteen distinct classes of facts in Christian history, all
of which bear witness to the Primacy, and which cannot
be studied without coming across that power. Such are, 1.
<i>the history of heresies</i>, where, in ancient times alone,
consider the acts and statutes of Pope Dionysius, in
the causes of Paul of Samosata, and Dionysius of Alexandria;
of Popes Sylvester and Julius, in the cause of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Arius; of Pope Damasus in that of Apollinarius; of
Popes Innocent and Zosimus in that of Pelagius; of
Pope Celestine in that of Nestorius; and of Pope Leo
in that of Eutyches; so that Ferrandus<a name="FNanchor_5_498" id="FNanchor_5_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_498" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> of Carthage
wrote in the sixth century, "If you desire to hear
aught of truth, ask in the first place the prelate of the
Apostolic See, whose sound doctrine is known by the
judgment of truth, and grounded on the weight of authority."
2. <i>The history of schisms</i>, which have arisen in
the Church, when we consider the unquestionable facts
about Novatian, Fortunatus and Felicissimus, the Donatists,
and Acacius of Constantinople, so that Bede, in
our own country, wrote in the seventh century, commenting
on Matt. xvi. 10, "All believers in the world
understand, that whosoever, in any way separate themselves
from the unity of the faith, or from the society
of Peter, such can neither be absolved from the bonds of
their sins, nor enter the threshold of the heavenly kingdom."
3. <i>The history of the liturgy</i>, as the contests
about the paschal time, and what Eusebius, in the fifth
book of his history, c. 22-5, says about Pope Victor.
4. <i>The history</i> of the <i>summoning</i>, the <i>holding</i>, and
the <i>confirming general councils</i>, wherein the Acts of
Synods, the letters of the supreme Pontiffs, and the
writings of the Fathers, show the entire truth of what
is stated by the ancient Greek historians, Socrates and
Sozomen,<a name="FNanchor_6_499" id="FNanchor_6_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_499" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> that an ecclesiastical Canon had always been
in force, "that the Churches should not pass Canons
contrary to the decision of the bishop of Rome," which
Pope Pelagius,<a name="FNanchor_7_500" id="FNanchor_7_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_500" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in the sixth century thus expressed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>"the right of calling councils is entrusted by a special
power to the Apostolic See, nor do we read that a general
council has been valid, which was not assembled or
supported by its authority. This is attested by the
authority of canons, corroborated by ecclesiastical history,
and confirmed by the holy Fathers." And Ferrandus
says, "Universal councils, more especially those to
which the authority of the Roman Church has been given,
hold the place of second authority after the canonical
books."<a name="FNanchor_8_501" id="FNanchor_8_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_501" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> 5. <i>The history of ecclesiastical laws</i>, for the
regulation of discipline, a summary of which, enacted by
the successors of Peter from Victor I. to Gregory II.,
may be found in Zaccaria's Antifebronius, Tom. ii., p.
425, and his Antifebronius Vindicatus, Diss. vi., c. 1.
6. <i>The history of judgments</i>, specially the most remarkable
in the Church, of which, if we are to believe history,
we can only repeat what Pope Gelasius wrote at
the end of the fifth century, to the Bishops of Dardania,
"We must not omit that the Apostolic See has
frequently, to use our Roman phrase, more majorum,
even without any council preceding, had the power to
absolve those whom a council had unjustly condemned,
or to condemn, without any council, those who required
condemnation:" and as he wrote to the Greek emperor,
Anastasius, "that the authority of the Apostolic See
has in all Christian ages been set over the Church universal,
is established by the series of the canons of the
Fathers, and by manifold tradition."<a name="FNanchor_9_502" id="FNanchor_9_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_502" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> 7. <i>The history
of references</i>, which were wont to be made to the chair
of Peter, in the greater causes of faith, and in those
respecting Catholic unity. Thus, Avitus, bishop of Vienne,
<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 500, said, "It is a rule of synodical laws, that, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>matters relating to the state of the Church, if any doubt
arises, we, as obedient members, recur to the priest
of the Roman Church, who is the greatest, as to our
head."<a name="FNanchor_10_503" id="FNanchor_10_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_503" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> To the same effect is the letter of Pope Innocent
I., to S. Victrice, of Rouen, at the beginning of
the fifth century, and again, the African Fathers to Pope
Theodore; or again, S. Bernard, writing to Pope Innocent
II., against the errors of Abelard, "All dangers and
scandals emerging in the kingdom of God, specially those
which concern faith, must be referred to your Apostolate:
for I esteem it fitting that the injuries done to faith
should be repaired there in particular, where faith cannot
fail. That is the prerogative of this See." 8. <i>The history
of appeals</i>, of which a vast number of remarkable
instances exist. Take, as the key, the words of Pope
Gelasius once more: "It is the canons themselves
which have ordered the appeals of the whole Church to
be carried to the examination of this See. But from it
they have allowed of no appeal in any case; and, therefore,
they enjoin that it should judge of the whole Church,
but go itself before the judgment of none: nor do they
allow of appeal from its sentence, but rather require obedience
to its decrees."<a name="FNanchor_11_504" id="FNanchor_11_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_504" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> And Pope Agatho, in the Roman
Council, pronouncing on the appeal of our own S. Wilfrid,
of York, the contemporary of Bede, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 688, declares
that "Wilfrid the bishop, beloved of God, knowing
himself unjustly deposed from his bishopric, did not <i>contumaciously
resist by means of the secular power</i>, but
with humility of mind sought the canonical aid of our
founder, blessed Peter, prince of the Apostles, and declared
in his supplication that he would accept what by
our mouth, blessed Peter, our founder, whose office we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>discharge, should determine."<a name="FNanchor_12_505" id="FNanchor_12_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_505" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> 9. <i>The history of the
ecclesiastical hierarchy</i>,<a name="FNanchor_13_506" id="FNanchor_13_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_506" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and of the <i>rights possessed by
certain episcopal Sees over others</i>, of which we may
take an instance in the grants of Pope Gregory the
Great, and his successors, to the See of Canterbury,
which alone made it a Primacy. For the bishops of
Canterbury had no power whatever over the other
bishops of this country, save what they derived from S.
Peter's See. And the documents, and original letters
conferring these powers still exist, giving the fullest
proof that Pope Pius only did in 1850, what Pope
Gregory did in 596. 10. <i>The history of the universal
propagation of the Christian religion.</i><a name="FNanchor_14_507" id="FNanchor_14_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_507" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> 11. <i>The history
of those tokens and pledges</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_508" id="FNanchor_15_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_508" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> such as letters of
communion, whereby Catholic unity was exhibited and
maintained. 12. <i>The history of Christian archæology</i>,<a name="FNanchor_16_509" id="FNanchor_16_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_509" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
inscriptions, paintings, and other monuments of this kind.
13. <i>The history of the emperors</i>, as, for instance, what
Ammianus Marcellinus<a name="FNanchor_17_510" id="FNanchor_17_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_510" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> says of Constantius; the letter
of the Emperor Marcian to Pope Leo, entreating him to
confirm the council of Chalcedon; that of Galla Placidia,
the 130th novel of Justinian, and the remarkable constitution
of Valentinian III., <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 445. "Since the merit
of S. Peter, who is the chief of the episcopal coronet,
and the dignity of the Roman city, moreover, the authority
of a sacred synod" (that of Sardica, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 347) "have
confirmed the Primacy of the Apostolic See, let presumption
not endeavour to attempt anything unlawful, contrary
to the authority of that See: for, then, at length, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>peace of the Church will everywhere be preserved, if the
whole (universitas) acknowledge its ruler." And, 14.
lastly, <i>the history of codes</i>, in which is contained the
legislation of Christian kingdoms, wherein we may refer
to the capitulars of the Franks, and the laws of the Lombards.</p>

<p>Now from these concordant proofs thus slightly sketched,
it follows that the institution of the Primacy belongs to
that class of facts which is most certain, and which is
absolutely demonstrated. For would it be possible to
find a concurrence of proofs so various in case it had
never been instituted? Is it possible to imagine so many
various results of a cause which never existed? So many
various tokens of reality in a fiction? What are the chances
for letters thrown at random forming themselves into an
eloquent speech? Or a beautiful portrait coming out
from a mere assemblage of colours? Or a whole discourse
in an unknown tongue being elegantly rendered
by a guess? If these be sheer absurdities, although a
few letters have sometimes tumbled at random into a
word, or a single clause been decyphered, though in
ignorance of the alphabet, then we may be sure that
the Primacy, attested by so vast a variety of convergent
results, can no more be untrue, than effects can exist
without a cause, splendour without light, or vocal harmony
without sound. Accordingly an institution established
by such a union of proof, carries prisoner the
assent. It may indeed be disregarded by a resolution of
the <i>will</i>, but can neither be passed by, nor refuted, by
a judgment of the <i>reason</i>.</p>

<p>And<a name="FNanchor_18_511" id="FNanchor_18_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_511" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> having on the one hand this vast amount of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span><i>positive</i> proof, from sources so various, in its behalf, so
that without it the whole Christian history of eighteen
centuries, in all its manifold blendings with secular history,
becomes unintelligible, a snarl which it is impossible
to arrange, when we come on the other hand to consider
what its opponents allege of <i>positive</i> on their own side,
we find nothing. They content themselves with objections
to this or that detached point, with historical difficulties,
and obscurations of the full proof, such, for
instance, as the conduct of S. Cyprian in one controversy,
the occasional resistance of a metropolitan, the
secular instinct of an imperial government stirring up
eastern bishops to revolt, and fostering an Erastian spirit
in the Church, the ambition of thoroughly bad men,
such as Acacius or Photius, and the like. But what
we may fairly ask of opponents, and what we never
find the most distant approach to in them is, if, as they
say, S. Peter's Primacy be not legitimate, and instituted
by Christ for the government of the Church, what <i>counter
system</i> have they, which they can prove by ancient
documents, and whereby they can solve the manifold facts
of history? In all their arguments against the Primacy they
are so absolutely <i>negative</i>, that the grand result, if they
were successful, would be to reduce the Church to a heap
of ruins, to show that she, who is entrusted with the authoritative
teaching of the world, has no internal coherence
either of government or doctrine, in fact, no message
from God to deliver, and no power to enforce it when
delivered. In the arguments of Greeks and Anglicans,
Lutherans and Calvinists, and all the Protestant sects,
the gates of hell have long ago prevailed against the
Church, and the devil has built up at his ease a city of
confusion on the rock which Christ chose for her foundation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
If we listen to them, never has victory been
more complete than that of the evil one over the Son
of God: the promised unity he has scattered to the
winds: the doctrine of truth he has utterly corrupted:
the charity wherewith Christians loved one another he
has turned into gall and wormwood. That is, the opponents
of S. Peter's Primacy are one and all simply
<i>destructives</i>; they inspire despair, and are the pioneers
of infidelity, but are utterly powerless to build up. Ask
the Anglican what is the source of spiritual jurisdiction,
and the bond of the episcopate which he affects to defend?
<i>He makes no reply.</i> All he can say is, it is <i>not</i>
S. Peter. Ask the Greek, if bishops and patriarch disagree,
and come to opposite judgments on the faith, or
to schisms in communion, which party make the Church?
<i>He has no solution to offer</i>, save that it is <i>not</i> the party
which sides with S. Peter's successor. Ask the pure
Protestant, who maintains the sole authority of the written
word, if you disagree about the meaning of Scripture
in points which you admit to touch salvation, who is to
determine what is the true meaning of the word of
God? <i>He has nothing to reply</i>, save that he is sure
it is <i>not</i> the Pope. Contrast, then, on the one side, a
complete coherent system, fully delineated and set forth
in the Bible, attested by the Fathers, corroborated by
analogy, and harmonising the history of eighteen hundred
years in its infinitely numerous relations, with, on
the other side, a mere heap of objections and denials,
with shreds of truths held without cohesion, with analogy
violated, history thrown into hopeless confusion, and to
crown the whole, Holy Scripture incessantly appealed to,
yet its plainest declarations recklessly disregarded, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
its most consoling promises utterly evacuated. Choose,
upon this, between <i>within</i> and <i>without</i>.</p>

<p>II. But such being the argument for the Primacy <i>of
itself</i> and <i>absolutely</i>, look at it now in a <i>comparative</i>
point of view with other doctrines. Let us ask Anglicans,
Lutherans, and Calvinists, respectively, to compare
it in order with the proofs with which they, each in
behalf of his own sect, defend either the authority of
bishops, and their distinction from presbyters, as instituted
by Christ, or the real presence of the Lord's body
in the Eucharist, or the divine nature of Christ, and His
consubstantiality with the Father. Can they state, upon
a comparison of these, that there are <i>more</i> testimonies of
Holy Scripture in behalf of these latter doctrines than for
the Primacy of Peter? As for the articles of the real
presence, and the superiority of bishops, this cannot be
asserted with any show of truth, since in behalf of both
there are undoubtedly fewer. Certainly there are a great
number for the divinity of Christ, yet not much less are
those which the same Scriptures contain in support of
Peter's Primacy. So that if the force of proof is to be
judged of by the <i>number of texts</i>, that in behalf of the
Primacy will either be preferred to the rest, or at least
yield to none.</p>

<p>But I anticipate the answer that it is not the number
of texts which will decide the question, but their perspicuity
and evidence, which constitute their force. To
meet which objection I shall merely set these several
parties against each other. What, then, do Lutherans
think of the perspicuity of those texts by which Anglicans
maintain the superiority of bishops over presbyters?
They are unanimous in thinking them not merely most
obscure, but absolutely foreign to the purpose for which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
they are cited. Just the same is the Calvinist opinion
of the Lutheran proofs for the real presence, and the
Socinian view of the texts alleged by Calvinists in behalf
of Christ's divinity. Both obstinately refuse to admit
that their opponents urge anything decisive. It would
be easy to quote instances of this, if it was not notorious.
It is, then, no unfair inference that Protestants have no
particular reason to boast triumphantly of the perspicuity
and evidence of the texts on which they severally
rely.</p>

<p>But who, they retort, cannot see that the cause of
the Primacy, which we defend, is far inferior? For our
exposition is opposed not by one or two parties, but by
them all in a mass, Anglicans, Lutherans, Calvinists, and
<i>all who are not Catholics</i>. The addition is significant,
<i>all who are not Catholics</i>, for indeed all these, and
these alone, are our opponents. Yet their very name
creates the gravest prejudice against them, and shows
them to be unworthy of attention. As S. Augustine
said, "The Catholic Church is one, to which different
heresies give various names, they themselves each possessing
their own name, which they dare not refuse.
Whence judges unaffected by partiality can form an
opinion to whom the name of Catholic, which all aim
at, ought to be given."<a name="FNanchor_19_512" id="FNanchor_19_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_512" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> If, then, the name of Catholic
is a note of truth, the negation of that name is a
test of error and heresy. But no one will imagine that
heretics, that is, the enemies of Christ and the Apostles,
have a right to be followed in what concerns the doctrine
of Christ, and the Apostolic institutions. Thus
what Tertullian said is to the point, "Though we had
to search still and for ever, yet <i>where</i> are we to search?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>Is it among heretics, where all is foreign and opposed
to our own truth, whom we are not allowed to approach?<a name="FNanchor_20_513" id="FNanchor_20_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_513" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
What servant expects food from a stranger, not to say
an enemy of his lord? What soldier takes donative or
pay from confederate, not to say from hostile kings, except
he be an open deserter and rebel? Even the woman
in the Gospel searched for her piece of silver within
her own house. Even he who knocked, struck the door
of a friend.<a name="FNanchor_21_514" id="FNanchor_21_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_514" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Even the widow solicited a judge, who
was hard indeed, but not her enemy. No one can be
built up by the person who destroys him. No one be
enlightened by one who shuts him up in darkness. Let
us search then in our own, and from our own, and about
our own, and only that which can be questioned without
harm to the rule of faith."<a name="FNanchor_22_515" id="FNanchor_22_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_515" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>But if we look closer into the matter, we shall find that
even in the interpretation of our texts Protestants are not
so agreed with each other as uniformly to oppose us. Some
of the greatest names amongst them, such as Camero,
Grotius, Hammond, Leclerc, Dodwell, Michaelis, Rosenmüller,
and Kuinoel, differ from the rest and agree with us
in interpreting, "upon this rock I will build My Church,"
words of great importance in the controversy about the
Primacy. So that we were not wrong in stating that Protestants
do not entirely agree among each other in their
interpretation, nor disagree with ours.</p>

<p>But grant that they were one and all opposed to it, it
would not prove much. For, <i>first</i>, it could hardly happen
otherwise, since the whole Protestant cause is so contained
in this matter of the Primacy, that, were they to confess
themselves wrong in it, they would pronounce themselves
guilty of the most groundless schism. Therefore it is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>matter of life and death with them to resist us. <i>Secondly</i>, as
they dissent from us, so do they desert that doctrine which
the whole Christian body solemnly professed and defined
before the sixteenth century in ecumenical councils, that of
Florence held in 1439, the second of Lyons in 1274, and
the fourth Lateran in 1215. We, then, follow antiquity,
and they take up novelty. And so it follows that while we
have Protestants against us, we have the earlier Christians
for us, whilst Protestants are opposed not only to the present
race of Catholics, but to those whose children these
are, and whose doctrines they have preserved. For as to
the ancient interpretation of these texts take the following
proof, contained in a letter of Pope Agatho to the Greek
emperor Heraclius, read and approved in the sixth general
council, <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 680.  "The true confession of Peter was
revealed by the Father from heaven, for which Peter was
pronounced to be blessed by the Lord of all, who likewise
by a triple commendation was entrusted with the feeding of
the spiritual sheep of the Church by the Redeemer of all
Himself; in virtue of whose assistance this his apostolical
church hath never turned aside from the path of truth to
any error whatsoever; whose authority, as of the Prince
of all the Apostles, the whole Catholic Church at all times
and the universal councils faithfully embracing, have in all
respects followed, and all the venerable Fathers have entertained
its apostolic doctrine; through which there have
shone the most approved lights of the Church; which
while the holy orthodox Fathers have venerated and followed,
<i>heretics have pursued with false accusations, and
calumnies inspired by hatred. This is the living tradition
of Christ's Apostles, which His Church everywhere
holds.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_23_516" id="FNanchor_23_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_516" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> We might imagine that Sir Thomas More had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>these words before his eyes when he answered Luther,
"not only all that learned and holy men have collected to
the point moves me to give willing obedience to that See,
but especially what we have so often witnessed, that not
only there never was an enemy to the Christian faith who
did not at the same time declare war against that See, but
also that there never has been one who professed himself
an enemy of that See without shortly after declaring himself
signally a capital foe and traitor of Christ and our
religion. Another thing, too, has great weight with me,
that if, in this manner, the faults of individuals are laid to
the charge of their office, all authority will collapse, and
the people will be without ruler, law, or order. And if
this ever happens, as it seems likely to happen in parts of
Germany, at length they will learn to their cost how much
more it is to the interest of society to have even bad rulers
rather than none."<a name="FNanchor_24_517" id="FNanchor_24_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_517" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>Protestants, then, have many more opponents than we;
to which we may add, <i>thirdly</i>, that we assert and maintain
a doctrine which for several ages had no opponents worth
mentioning, and which received a general belief and assent.
Protestants, on the contrary, no sooner brought their
doctrine to light than they roused the whole Catholic
Church against them; that very Church, <i>fourthly</i>, from
which they had rebelled, in which they had been washed
in the laver of regeneration, whose motherly care had
enrolled them as Christians, from which they had received
the Bible and all other Christian blessings, which, before
that fatal schism, alone presented the appearance of the
true Church, and was invested with attributes which inspired
belief and fostered obedience. For such were antiquity,
the hierarchy, unity, the agreement of its members,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>universality; such, again, the splendour of sanctity
and learning; zeal in the guardianship of primeval tradition,
hatred of profane novelties; and, lastly, the renown
of those heavenly gifts, which cannot fail the true Church
of Christ, and were ascribed to no other body.</p>

<p>But <i>fifthly</i>, it would be very apposite to compare the
Catholic Church with herself, and contrast her state and
condition in the nineteenth century with that same state
and condition in the fourth, the fifth, and the sixth. Now
who, in the fourth century, professed the consubstantiality
of the Trinity? Well nigh Catholics alone, while innumerable
sects of heretics opposed this doctrine. War to the
knife was waged against it by Praxeans, Noetians, Sabellians,
Paulianists, Arians, and their worst portion, the
Anomæans, Macedonians, and those who then made their
appearance, Tritheists. Again, in the fifth and the sixth
centuries, who were they who retained the true faith in
Christ the God-Man, and His dispensation in taking flesh?
Once more the true faith was hardly found outside the
Catholics, while the followers of Theodore of Mopsuestia,
and Diodorus of Tarsus, Nestorius and the Nestorians,
Eutyches, and the Eutychean sects at daggers drawn
with each other, and in fine, the Monothelites and their
sects, who hated one another and the Catholics with equal
bitterness, clubbed all their forces together to oppose it.
Now do any Protestants venture to infer that in the fourth
and following centuries the cause of the Catholic Church
was less certain, on account of this mob of hostile sects?
I should consider such an insinuation an insult to them.
They must accordingly allow my parallel inference, that it
is fair to pass the same judgment on the cause of the
Primacy now for some centuries defended by the Catholics
against the Protestants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, to address specially Lutherans and Anglicans.
They are well aware that almost all sects are not more
opposed to the supremacy of Peter than to the superiority
of bishops, and the verity of the Lord's body in the
Eucharist. But are they therefore deterred by the number
of their enemies, or do they distrust the goodness of
their cause, or doubt the perspicuity of those documents on
which they rely for the victory? They can afford to
disdain the tricks of their opponents, as well as repulse
their attacks. They must, accordingly, agree with us that
the assertions or denials of contesting parties ought not to
be, and cannot be, the test of a cause's goodness, and of
documentary evidence.</p>

<p>But, then, by what standard are we to go? I reply, by
those criteria which are not subject to just exception, and
which must be approved by all who seek the truth, and
obey the dictate of reason. Now four such criteria in
chief I think may be assigned, the two former of which
are <i>immediate</i> and <i>internal</i>, the third <i>internal</i>, but somewhat
more remote; the fourth, <i>external</i>, but of great
weight, and not to be overlooked. To speak of the former
first; one of these is <i>verbal</i>, and belongs to the words
and phrases of which the text consists; the other <i>real</i>,
and regards the meaning of the sentence. Indeed, no
other sources of obscurity or of clearness can be imagined
than either the <i>words</i> which express the <i>matter</i>, or the
<i>matter</i> intended by the <i>words</i>. If both words and matter
are plain, and perspicuous, the discourse will be clear,
and the language distinct; but if either the matter exceed
the power of reason, or the words do not run clear, or both
these conspire, the evidence of the meaning will be more
or less impaired.</p>

<p>I. Now, to begin with <i>words</i>, I shall not be severe, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
allow to Anglicans, Lutherans, and Calvinists, that the
texts alleged by each of them in behalf of his own cause
consist of words which are either immediately perspicuous,
or become mediately clear upon definite principles. But
in turn I should ask them repeatedly to consider whether
such a perspicuity can be denied to the words of which the
texts cited for the Primacy of Peter consist. These words
are in general and vulgar use, continually repeated in the
Bible, but so connected together that their certain meaning
is either immediately evident, or fixed with very little
trouble. But are not most of them metaphorical, such as
<i>rock</i>, <i>building</i>, <i>keys</i>, <i>binding</i>, <i>loosing</i>, <i>lambs</i>, <i>sheep</i>, <i>feeding</i>?
Undoubtedly some are such, yet not that words
used in their <i>proper</i> sense are wanting, as when Peter is
called <i>the first</i>, <i>the greater</i>, the <i>superior</i>; also when he is
charged <i>to confirm his brethren</i>; and what we collect from
the Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles of S. Paul, and the
evangelists' mode of writing. Not, <i>secondly</i>, that it is not
evident, from the connection of the discourse, what fixed
and established meaning must be given to those metaphorical
expressions. Not, thirdly, that the meaning of those
formulas is not shown by the exercise of the powers conferred
in them. Not, fourthly, that there is any inability,
if you remove the metaphor, to express in <i>proper</i> words
what the metaphor shadows out. Not, fifthly, as if the
literal and immediate sense were therefore wanting; for it
is very plain that the metaphorical<a name="FNanchor_25_518" id="FNanchor_25_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_518" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> sense likewise is
literal and immediate. And sixthly, not that <i>metaphorical</i>
can be considered equivalent to <i>obscure</i>, for obscurity is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>most opposed to the very genius of metaphor, and such a
canon would destroy the perspicuity of human language.
For there is no language, ancient or modern, rude or
polished, semitic, chamitic, or japhetic, whose <i>metaphorical</i>
is not much more copious than its <i>proper</i> vocabulary.</p>

<p>Metaphor, then, and obscurity are very far removed
from each other, and there is nothing to prevent a metaphorical
expression bearing the plainest sense. For such
the sense will be, whenever what is called the <i>foundation</i>
of the metaphor is clear, and the series of the discourse
indicates <i>the point of likeness</i>, and usage of speech unfolds
<i>the force</i> of the metaphor. Now all these conditions,
which ensure perspicuity in the metaphor, are found in
interpreting the metaphors which contain the singular prerogatives
of Peter. For as it is perfectly plain whence the
metaphors of <i>foundation</i>, <i>building</i>, <i>keys</i>, <i>binding</i>, <i>loosing</i>,
<i>sheep</i>, <i>lambs</i>, <i>shepherd</i>, are drawn, so the context defines
the point of similitude, and usage of speech does not allow
ignorance of the force of such metaphors. And thus the
texts on Peter's Primacy have a verbal perspicuity which
will bear a favourable comparison with those texts, on
which Anglicans, Lutherans, and Calvinists rely. For
indeed all the difficulties, in the invention of which Protestants
have shown their ingenuity, are introduced, put
upon the words, not drawn from them. So on the contrary,
the haters of the Primacy evidently wince at their clearness.</p>

<p>2. <i>Verbal</i> perspicuity is followed by <i>real</i>, or that which
concerns the <i>subject matter</i>. And this, I assert, is far
inferior, far more slender, in the above named Protestant
controversies, than in this of the Catholics. Indeed, both
the controversies, on the real presence and on the divinity
of Christ, have a super-intelligible object, so far exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
the natural power of reason, as to admit of the mind's
conceiving it by analogy, but not by a <i>distinct</i> and <i>proper</i>
knowledge. For this is the nature of mysteries, whence
it follows in them that neither single words have distinct
notions, nor a whole proposition distinct sense. Whereas
in the controversy about the Primacy, there is nothing
which is not commensurate with reason, and which
has not the advantage of proper and distinct notions.
For, of revealed truths, some being <i>rational</i>, some <i>beyond</i>
reason, and some <i>above</i> reason, the proper character
of those which are called <i>beyond</i> reason is, that, <i>if</i>
revealed, they are cognizable by reason. Now to such
an order of truths the institution of the Primacy belongs.
Thus its <i>real</i> evidence, that namely which concerns
its <i>subject matter</i>, is much superior to that which
the others admit of. But should we grant as much to
the controversy in which Anglicans defend the superiority
of bishops over presbyters? Grant this, yet still
it remains that in this species of <i>real</i> evidence the cause
of the Primacy is far superior to that of the real presence,
or that of the divinity of Christ. But, in truth, the Anglican
doctrine on bishops may be considered from two points
of view, either as severed from the Catholic dogma on
Peter's Primacy, or as in connexion and coherence with
it. From the latter point of view I should admit it to
be so agreeable to reason, that this power calls for it,
and rests in it, when once illuminated by faith, so as
to know, that is, the purpose of Christ that each particular
Church should present the aspect of an united
family. But sever this superiority of bishops over presbyters
from the dogma of the Primacy, and inveigh as
keenly against Peter's supremacy as you defend their
presidency, which is what Anglicans do, and then I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
only conclude that this doctrine is plainly contrary to
reason instead of agreeing with it.</p>

<p>For whence do Anglicans deduce its agreement with
reason? Hammond, Pearson, Beveridge, Bingham, and
their other greater theologians, tell us that it follows
very plainly, because we know that Christ carefully provided
for the unity of particular Churches, which, they say,
it seems impossible to obtain without the superior power
of bishops. It is a good inference; but did Christ show
less care for the unity of the whole Church than for
that of particular Churches? Who can seriously maintain
this? For what is the unity recommended by Christ and
so earnestly urged by the Apostles, save that of the whole
Church? And when we acknowledge in the creed <i>one</i>
Church, do we mean a particular or the universal Church?
We mean that which we also acknowledge to be Catholic,
and therefore the unity is that of the Catholic Church.
And therefore it was Christ's intention, and His certain
will, that not only particular Churches, but the universal
body of the Church, should possess the test and the dower
of unity. And this Anglican notion, which denies of the
universal Church, what it affirms of particular Churches,
may suit very well an island, holding itself aloof from
the rest of the world, but it is quite incompatible with
the radical idea of the kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p>Moreover, if it was necessary for the production and
maintenance of unity in particular Churches to set bishops
over them, with authority superior to that of presbyters;
if reason demands that it being Christ's will for particular
Churches to live in unity, He should likewise have instituted
the power which distinguishes bishops from presbyters;
can we suppose either that it was not necessary
for the production and maintenance of unity in the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
Church, to commit its government to an universal superior,
or that reason does not <i>equally</i> require, that Christ,
who enjoined the Catholic Church to maintain unity,
should have instituted the universal Pastor? Nay, as
the necessity is not equal on the two sides, but so much
stronger on the side of unity in the <i>Catholic</i> Church, as
it is more difficult to hold together in one an innumerable
than a limited number, men scattered over the globe
than men within a narrow region, nations differing in
genius, habits, and laws, than those who resemble each
other in these; so reason, which for particular Churches
requires their respective bishops, <i>much more</i> requires the
institution of a <i>universal</i> superior, lest the end should
appear to have been devised without the means, and
the divine work of Christ be deficient in wisdom. What,
then, are Anglicans about in dividing these two doctrines,
and contending for the institution of bishops, while they
obstinately deny the institution of the Primacy? They
strip of its authority the very truth which they defend,
and by severing doctrines which derive their consistency
from their cohesion, put weapons in the hands of
presbyterians to assault and even overthrow the very
dogma from which they take their name of episcopalians.
Accordingly the evidence derived from the <i>subject matter</i>
is much clearer in those texts which are alleged for Peter's
Primacy, than in those by which the superiority of bishops
over presbyters, the real presence, and the divine person of
Christ, are proved.</p>

<p>Now the force of demonstration derived from documents
corresponds to the sum of <i>verbal</i> and <i>real</i> evidence in the
texts, being greater or less as this is stronger or weaker.
In other words, the force of demonstration belongs to that
class of evidence which mathematicians call <i>direct</i>. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
both these sorts of evidence exist in the same, or even in
a fuller degree, in those texts which concern the Primacy,
and set forth its divine institution. Accordingly the force
of demonstration for the Primacy is equal or superior to
that belonging to the arguments which prove the superiority
of bishops, the real presence, and Christ's divine
person. Yet these arguments have such force, that the
articles which they prove cannot, in the opinion of Anglicans,
Lutherans, and Calvinists, be questioned without incurring
the deepest guilt of heresy. We have, then, the same
or even a stronger reason to affirm that the Primacy of
Peter, resting on the same, or even a stronger, evidence,
as <i>revealed</i>, cannot be denied without heresy.</p>

<p>And this is a corollary which I would entreat Anglicans,
Lutherans, and Calvinists, carefully to consider, and
then say whether they are consistent; for then I feel
assured they would become discontented with themselves,
by reflecting that, in the choice of the articles which
they hold, they are not following the clearness of revelation,
but party spirit and factious prejudices. What
satisfactory answer can they ever return to the Catholic
who asks why they, who on equal or less evidence defend
the superiority of bishops, deny the Primacy which
rests on similar or greater proof? Or why they attack
the Primacy, while they defend the real presence, or
the divinity of Christ, which are supported by no more
evident arguments? And how will they satisfy their
own conscience, should this thought ever cross them,
"Why do I at one time obey, at another time resist,
the same evidence of revelation?" That same faith with
which they severally believe the divine appointment of
bishops, the real presence, and the consubstantiality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Christ, compels them, if they would maintain consistency,
and not repel conviction, to confess the Primacy of Peter.</p>

<p>And this argument might be carried much further, if
they would reflect how great is the brilliancy of evidence
in behalf of the Primacy, compared with sundry other
capital Christian doctrines, some or all of which they
hold without question: such are the consubstantiality of
the Trinity, the unity of Christ's Person, the propagation
of original sin, the eternity of punishment, regeneration
in baptism, and gratuitous justification. They
will find, on reflection, that they hold these doctrines
not because they are proved by stronger scriptural evidence
than the Primacy, for quite the reverse is the
truth, nor because they are encompassed with less obscurity
in their own character, for the subject matter
of the Primacy is clear and distinct in comparison with
them all, but because the doctrines do not oppose the
particular tradition which they have received, and so
their minds are not set against them. Let them once
come to compare the whole evidence for the Primacy,
scriptural, traditional, analogical, and historical, which
last alone comprehends the fourteen heads above enumerated,
with the same evidence in behalf of any or all of
those, and they cannot but admit its great superiority.</p>

<p>3. But we must proceed to the <i>third</i> criterion, which
increases not a little the evidence from revelation for
the Primacy. For Catholics and Protestants are agreed
in considering <i>analogy</i> as one of the best helps in interpretation,
and in assigning to it the force of a real
parallelism, a proceeding which rests on the necessity
of the Scripture presenting one whole and harmonious
body of doctrine in its several parts. And in order not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
to deprive this help of its efficacy, both parties give two
conditions for its exercise, the first, <i>that no sense be put
upon passages of Scripture contrary to analogy</i>; the
second, <i>that no violence be used to the language of
Scripture to conform it with analogy, which would be
imposing on holy writ the sense wanted from it</i>. These
two faults carefully avoided, analogy is of great service,
and throws much light upon interpretation.</p>

<p>But, now, is there such a sum of doctrine, so remarkable,
and so diffused through all the books of the New
Testament, that the texts expressing the gifts and prerogatives
of Peter, can be tried by the touchstone of this
analogy? Such, indeed, there is, very remarkable, and
threefold in character. The first point is found in the
texts<a name="FNanchor_26_519" id="FNanchor_26_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_519" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> which regard the divine institution of bishops:
the other two in those which show the unity,<a name="FNanchor_27_520" id="FNanchor_27_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_520" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and the
Catholicity<a name="FNanchor_28_521" id="FNanchor_28_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_521" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> of the Church. For what can stand in closer
connection with these articles of doctrine, than the appointment
of a supreme ruler to discharge over the universal
Church the office which every bishop exercises over
his own particular Church, and his own portion of the flock?
What, again, can be more opposed to them, than the
supposition that provision was made, by the institution of
bishops, for <i>the parts</i>, but none, by the institution of
a supreme pastor, for <i>the whole body</i>, which is to be one
and Catholic? Therefore, that exposition of the texts
concerning Peter, which exhibits him as ruler of the
Church universal, and as made to be the visible cause of
that same Catholic unity, so admirably agrees with
analogy, that it must be considered unquestionable, unless</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p><p>texts contradictory to it can be produced. But so
far is it from the case that texts <i>considered in themselves</i>
contradict it, that, on the contrary, they <i>immediately</i>
express it <i>of themselves</i>, and can be distorted from it
only by violating all the laws of interpretation. Accordingly,
that view of the texts about Peter, which establishes
his Primacy, is wonderfully confirmed by analogy,
and by its harmony with what the Scriptures tell us of
the Church, as instituted by Christ.</p>

<p>4. And nothing will be wanting to give full assurance
to this confirmation, if we add the <i>fourth or external</i> criterion,
that derived from consent of witnesses. I am not
going to urge here the divine force and infallible authority
of Christian tradition: I shall merely allege what no
person of discretion can deny or question. The first
point is, that in the actual controversy the testimony of
the most ancient witnesses cannot be disregarded: and
the second, that it carries the very strongest prejudice in
favour of whichever interpretation it supports.</p>

<p>Now here we have to do first, with the interpretation
of a series of dogmatic texts; and, secondly, with a
point of doctrine, which, being of the utmost moment,
could not be unknown to any one. But are these matters
on which ancient witnesses, such as the Christian Fathers,
and ecclesiastical writers, can be safely past by unheard?
If it were a matter of geography, chronology, or archæology,
one might allow it, though with regret: but this
is out of the question, in a matter of dogmatic texts,
and those relating to a most important doctrine. For
notorious is the zeal with which the ancient Fathers
laboured to preserve and interpret the dogmatic texts
of Scripture. We know their care to prevent the introduction
of new and false interpretations, and new and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
false doctrines thence arising. And we know that,
together with the Scriptures, they received from the
Apostolic teaching the kindred power of interpreting
them. For, as Origen remarked, "Since there are
many who think that they believe what is of Christ,
and some of them believe what is different from those
before them, yet, since the preaching of the Church is
preserved, as handed down by the order of succession
from the Apostles, and to the present day abiding in
the Church, that verity alone is to be believed, which
in nothing is discordant from the ecclesiastical and Apostolical
tradition."<a name="FNanchor_29_522" id="FNanchor_29_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_522" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>Moreover, can it seem safe to enter upon a track most
divergent from that which the Apostles marked out, and
the Christian people constantly followed? S. Paul<a name="FNanchor_30_523" id="FNanchor_30_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_523" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> taught
us to listen to witnesses, and Christendom, whether assembled
in council, or everywhere diffused, was content to
depend on them. Most clear is what is said on this point
about the Fathers at Nicea<a name="FNanchor_31_524" id="FNanchor_31_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_524" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and Ephesus,<a name="FNanchor_32_525" id="FNanchor_32_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_525" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and no less
so the words of Leontius<a name="FNanchor_33_526" id="FNanchor_33_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_526" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> of Byzantium, John Cassian,<a name="FNanchor_34_527" id="FNanchor_34_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_527" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
Theodoret,<a name="FNanchor_35_528" id="FNanchor_35_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_528" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Augustine,<a name="FNanchor_36_529" id="FNanchor_36_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_529" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Jerome,<a name="FNanchor_37_530" id="FNanchor_37_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_530" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Epiphanius,<a name="FNanchor_38_531" id="FNanchor_38_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_531" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Basil,<a name="FNanchor_39_532" id="FNanchor_39_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_532" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
Origen,<a name="FNanchor_40_533" id="FNanchor_40_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_533" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Tertullian,<a name="FNanchor_41_534" id="FNanchor_41_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_534" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Clement<a name="FNanchor_42_535" id="FNanchor_42_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_535" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> of Alexandria, and the
oldest of all, Irenæus,<a name="FNanchor_43_536" id="FNanchor_43_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_536" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> who says, "The true knowledge is</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p><p>the doctrine of the Apostles, and the ancient state of the
Church in the whole world, and the character of the body
of Christ, according to the succession of bishops, by which
they handed down the Church, which is in every place,
which hath reached even to us, being guarded without
fiction, <i>with a most full interpretation of the Scriptures</i>,
admitting neither addition nor subtraction, and the reading
without falsification, and legitimate and diligent exposition
according to the Scriptures, without danger, and
without blasphemy, and the chief gift of charity, which is
more precious than knowledge, more glorious than prophecy,
more eminent than all graces." For, as he says
elsewhere, "We ought to learn the truth, where the gifts
of the Lord are placed; among whom is that succession of
the Church, which is from the Apostles, sound and irreproachable
conversation, and discourse unadulterated and
incorrupt. For these maintain that faith of ours in one
God, who made all things: these increase that love towards
the Son of God, who has made for our sake so great dispositions:
<i>these explain to us the Scriptures without
peril</i>."</p>

<p>And, besides, where is the Protestant who does not
praise the Hebrew illustrations of Lightfoot, Schoettgen,
and Meuschen? or who does not at least make much of the
commentaries of Aben Ezra, Kimchi, Jarchi, and others,
in the interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures? They all
see the advantage of approaching such sources of information,
and using them for their own purpose. But are we
to refuse to the Fathers, and ancient doctors of the Church
the deference which we allow to Rabbins and Thalmudists?
This is at least a reason for hearing the testimony of the
Fathers.</p>

<p>And if it be concordant, constant, and universal, it most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
powerfully recommends that scriptural interpretation, which
agrees with it. In this, all Catholics without exception,
and the most judicious and learned Protestants, are agreed.
In good truth, it would be incredible that an interpretation
could be false, which was adopted unanimously by the
Fathers of every age and country. And it ought to be
as incredible to find any one so conceited, as not to be
greatly moved by the witness and consent of Christian antiquity.</p>

<p>One point of enquiry remains, whether the Fathers have
given their opinion, and that unanimously, on Peter and
the texts, which relate to him. But their words<a name="FNanchor_44_537" id="FNanchor_44_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_537" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> inserted
in the foregoing pages entirely terminate this controversy,
and show that they were all of the mind expressed by
Gregory the Great, in these words, which, it is well to
remember, were directed to the supreme civil authority
of those days, for he tells the emperor:</p>

<p>"To all who know the Gospel, it is manifest that the
charge of the whole Church was entrusted by the voice
of the Lord to the holy Apostle Peter, Prince of all the
Apostles. For to him it is said, 'Peter, lovest thou Me?
Feed My sheep.' To him is said, 'Behold, Satan hath
desired to sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for thee,
Peter, that thy faith fail not; and do thou, one day, in
turn, confirm thy brethren.' To him is said, 'Thou art
Peter, and upon this rock I will build My Church,' &amp;c.
Lo, he hath received the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
the power of binding and loosing is given to him, the care
and the chiefship of the whole Church is committed to
him."<a name="FNanchor_45_538" id="FNanchor_45_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_538" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
